/**
 * Every contributor entry point must say that building from source needs a local `bun`, and
 * must keep that separate from the bundled runtime that ships inside the npm package. Users
 * who install `ocx` never need their own Bun; contributors always do.
 *
 * Each file is checked as one whole normalized paragraph rather than as scattered fragments.
 * Matching fragments independently across a whole file passes even after the explanatory
 * sentence is deleted, as long as the words survive somewhere else — that is a test that
 * cannot fail for the reason it exists. Whitespace normalization keeps a maintainer's
 * paragraph rewrap from breaking the suite over nothing.
