title: Adapters
description: The provider adapters — what each targets, how it builds requests, and its quirks.
---

An **adapter** translates between opencodex's internal request/response model and one provider wire
format. Every adapter implements the `ProviderAdapter` interface (`src/adapters/base.ts`):

```ts
interface ProviderAdapter {
  name: string;
  buildRequest(parsed: OcxParsedRequest, incoming: IncomingMeta): AdapterRequest | Promise<AdapterRequest>;
  fetchResponse?(request: AdapterRequest, ctx?: AdapterFetchContext): Promise<Response>;
  parseStream(response: Response, budget: TranslatorBudget): AsyncGenerator<AdapterEvent>;
  parseResponse?(response: Response, budget: TranslatorBudget): Promise<AdapterEvent[]>;
  runTurn?(parsed: OcxParsedRequest, incoming: IncomingMeta, emit: (event: AdapterEvent) => void): Promise<void>;
}
```

`buildRequest` lowers an `OcxParsedRequest` into an upstream HTTP request; `parseStream` /
`parseResponse` lift the provider's reply back into internal `AdapterEvent`s. `fetchResponse` lets an
adapter own retries/timeouts, while `runTurn` supports transports that cannot be represented as one
HTTP fetch followed by one response stream. [`bridge.ts`](/reference/architecture/#the-bridge)
then turns the events into Responses SSE.

## External task input on translated Responses routes

Codex task coordination can deliver input as `function_call_output` with nonblank
`id`, `name` and `namespace` fields and no `call_id` property. OpenCodex maps this
complete envelope to a user message before adapter translation. Its output must be
nonblank text or a fully supported array of text and `input_image` URL parts. Text
and image order are preserved; image detail `original` maps to `high`.

Empty content, malformed or opaque parts, file-id-only images and partial envelopes
remain invalid. Ordinary function/custom tool results still require a nonempty
`call_id`. The envelope metadata identifies a compatibility shape and grants no
additional permissions. Native passthrough and compaction retain their raw-body rules.

## `openai-chat`

**Targets:** OpenAI **Chat Completions** (`POST {baseUrl}/chat/completions`; a trailing `/chat/completions` or `/` on `baseUrl` is stripped first) and every compatible
provider — xAI, Kimi, DeepSeek, GLM, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama (local), and more.
**Auth:** `key` (Bearer).

For xAI, the resolved upstream adapter can be `openai-chat` or `openai-responses`,
depending on model defaults and explicit `modelAdapters` overrides. Both support
public xAI API-key authentication and Grok CLI OAuth. The usage log's
[`attempts[].credentialSource`](/reference/management-api/) follows that resolved
transport; it does not infer subscription attribution from the inbound protocol.

- Converts internal messages to OpenAI roles; maps tools to `{type:"function", function:{…}}` and
  `tool_choice` (`auto`/`none`/`required` or a named function).
- **Tool-result images** ride in a follow-up user vision message (`image_url` parts) released once
  the tool round closes, since `role:"tool"` content is text-only; the `[image]` marker stays in the
  tool message as the anchor.
- **Rewrites Codex's GPT-5 identity prompt** to a model-agnostic intro so routed models don't claim to
  be OpenAI.
- **Clamps `reasoning_effort`** to the model's advertised subset when an exact tier is unavailable;
  `xhigh` and `max` remain distinct labels unless a provider explicitly configures an alias. The
  adapter **omits it entirely** for ids in `provider.noReasoningModels`.
- Streams `delta.content` (text), `delta.reasoning_content` (thinking), and `delta.tool_calls[]`;
  collects `usage`. Providers listed in `reasoningDetailsModels` (MiniMax M-series) instead read
  structured `delta.reasoning_details` segments, whose `text` arrives as cumulative snapshots and
  is prefix-diffed, and replay preserved reasoning as a `reasoning_details` array.
- Suppresses bare `<tool_call>` text when it duplicates a structured call, and collapses two
  immediately adjacent identical blocks when exactly one structured call agrees with their function
  and input. A doubled `input` is reduced to one copy, joined either directly or by one newline,
  and only when the arguments object holds no key besides `input`. Trailing whitespace after the
  pair is suppressed; mismatched or example markup remains visible.
- ClinePass uses the live-verified gateway format `reasoning: { enabled: true, effort }` (or
  `{ enabled: false }` when reasoning is disabled); its public API docs do not currently specify
  this request shape. The adapter preserves requested `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`
  tiers, accepts reasoning deltas from either `delta.reasoning_content` or `delta.reasoning`, requests
  streamed usage with `stream_options.include_usage`, and reads usage from non-stream response envelopes.

Streaming tool calls retain their identity when a provider first sends an ID,
then associates that ID with an index, and later sends index-only argument
fragments. Those fragments assemble into one call with the original name and
complete arguments; parallel calls retain separate identities.
When present, streamed tool-call indexes must be non-negative safe integers. Non-numeric
values and negative, fractional, or unsafe numbers terminate the stream with an upstream
error before identity matching. Missing and null indexes remain absent-index placeholders;
numeric strings are not coerced.

## `ollama-native`

**Targets:** Ollama's own **Chat API** (`POST /api/chat`) rather than its OpenAI-compatible
surface. The built-in `ollama-cloud` provider is registry-selected onto this adapter; it can also
be configured on a separately named custom or self-hosted Ollama provider with
`adapter: "ollama-native"`.
**Auth:** `key` (Bearer) for cloud/custom endpoints; no credential is sent to loopback or
`authMode: "local"` targets.

- **Registry selection is load-bearing.** The built-in `ollama-cloud` row keeps the base URL
  `https://ollama.com/v1` for `/v1/models` live discovery, while inference is normalized onto
  `POST https://ollama.com/api/chat`. A config-level `adapter` is discarded for that provider row.
  Ordinary built-in local Ollama stays on `openai-chat`; choosing `ollama-native` for a local or
  self-hosted endpoint is an explicit provider-configuration decision, detected by host so a
  non-Ollama destination is never silently rewritten.
- **Model metadata:** `/v1/models` carries no per-model metadata, so for canonical Ollama Cloud the
  adapter's provider enriches each discovered id through a *bounded* `POST /api/show` (256 KiB per
  response, 8 s per request, concurrency 4, 48 requests, a 12 s deadline for the whole phase) to fill
  the true context window and vision capability. The show request is same-origin and never follows a
  redirect; failures degrade that one model and never fail discovery.
- **Streaming:** Ollama's native NDJSON. Text and `message.thinking` deltas are forwarded as they
  arrive; a turn completes only on a `done: true` terminal record, and buffered `done: false` or a
  missing terminal suppresses partial text and tool calls entirely.
- **Reasoning:** maps onto Ollama's native `think` field (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`max`, plus
  booleans), clamped to the model's advertised ladder, and honours the `__omit__` sentinel semantics
  upstream configures.
- **Images:** sent natively in the message `images` array where the model is vision-capable; video
  is refused rather than mis-sent, and remote image URLs are not fetched.
- **Tools:** declared in Ollama's native shape, streamed tool calls are whole-call records with
  object-valued `arguments`, and tool-result replay is paired strictly by call id and tool name.
  `tool_choice: "none"` and `auto` behave normally; **`required` or an exact named choice fails
  closed**, because Ollama's `/api/chat` has no `tool_choice` field to enforce it with.
- **Structured output is refused on canonical Ollama Cloud.** Ollama currently documents structured
  outputs as unsupported on its Cloud, and Cloud does not enforce the `format` field, so OpenCodex
  fails that request closed rather than returning unconstrained prose in answer to a schema-shaped
  request. Local and custom `ollama-native` endpoints keep Ollama's native `format` mapping
  (`json_object` → `"json"`, `json_schema` → the schema object).

## `openai-responses`

**Targets:** the OpenAI **Responses API**. **`passthrough: true`** — normally forwards the raw request
body and response, with narrow compatibility rewrites for routed gateways.
**Auth:** canonical OpenAI `forward` relays only the safe caller-header allowlist; noncanonical
`forward` uses configured static headers without relaying caller authorization; `key` uses the
configured provider key.

The adapter preserves the incoming client's `User-Agent` as a fallback in both auth modes because
some Responses-compatible providers use the Codex client fingerprint for compatibility behavior.
An explicitly configured provider `User-Agent` remains authoritative regardless of header casing;
if the caller sends none, OpenCodex does not invent one. No other caller header is widened by this
exception.

Adapter selection does not select the upstream transport. Eligible requests can use the
[upstream WebSocket proxy route](/reference/proxy-formats/#json-and-sse-output); invalid or unsupported
WebSocket proxy settings fall back to HTTP/SSE. HTTP fetch-based Responses handling uses the
[configured outbound fetch](/reference/configuration/server/#server-fields): a server SOCKS5 proxy from
`config.proxy` or a SOCKS5 `ALL_PROXY` uses the built-in tunnel when `NO_PROXY` does not exempt
the target. Scheme-specific HTTP(S) proxy variables retain their separate native handling;
non-SOCKS `ALL_PROXY` is not a native HTTP fetch route.

Noncanonical Responses gateways receive Codex's client-executed `tool_search` declaration as a
collision-safe public function tool. Matching request history and JSON/SSE function calls are
translated back to the private `tool_search` lifecycle for the client. Canonical OpenAI forward
keeps the native private type unchanged.

Requests with `authMode` other than `"forward"` convert Codex `agent_message`
items containing nonempty arrays of supported plaintext parts into public user messages, preserving those parts and readable author/recipient
metadata. `agent_message` is private to the ChatGPT Codex backend, and the routed
destinations reported so far reject the entire body with
`422 unknown item type "agent_message"` — and because Codex replays sub-agent history on
every turn, that failure repeats for the rest of the thread. This conversion leaves
encrypted or unknown content unchanged. Providers using `authMode: "forward"` retain
these items unchanged. For xAI Responses on HTTPS `api.x.ai` or `cli-chat-proxy.grok.com`
using the standard port, a nonblank string child result is also converted into an `input_text`
part with its exact whitespace and newlines. Other destinations retain string-valued items;
blank strings and mixed encrypted/unknown parts are not partially converted.
See [agent messages](/reference/configuration/providers/#routed-agent-messages)
for the separate opt-in encrypted-task recovery behavior.

For xAI Responses, `auto` or `none` tool selection is omitted when normalization leaves no tools
in the request, including when cached-only search is removed. Valid forced function selections
remain intact. Replayed custom tool calls with missing or invalid item ids receive stable ids
when their call id, name, and input are strings; their call/result pairing is preserved.

The canonical ChatGPT Codex forward destination also normalizes two public Responses shapes that
its stricter backend rejects: fully textual `system` messages inside `input` are appended to the
top-level `instructions` string in request order, and the top-level `truncation` field is removed.
This rewrite is destination-scoped. Key-auth public/custom Responses providers and noncanonical
forward gateways keep both fields unchanged; a multimodal system message is never partially folded
or silently dropped.

For canonical forward continuations, client-only `prompt_cache_breakpoint` properties are removed
recursively within bounded traversal limits. When `store: false`, `item_reference` rows are also
omitted because the destination cannot resolve an item it did not persist. Function/tool `call_id`
pairs and `reasoning.effort` are preserved.

[Luna Reserve compatibility](/reference/cli/providers-accounts/#luna-reserve-alongside-routed-models)
uses this canonical ChatGPT-forward path, not key-auth or arbitrary Responses gateways. It retains
the safe caller-header allowlist and destination-scoped request normalization described here.
OpenCodex sends its Reserve capability header on the owned main-account usage lookup; that header
is not itself permission. Eligible compatibility requests recheck credential-bound authorization
at dispatch. Conversation and compaction are supported; vision helpers, web-search helpers, and
standalone search relay are not.

For `key` auth, [`retryOn429`](/reference/configuration/) applies here too: a pre-stream 429
waits and replays the identical request on the same key before any other handling, exactly like
the translated `openai-chat` / Anthropic request path. Custom `runTurn` transports are not part
of the HTTP retry loop.

- DeepSeek's stateless Responses parser receives provider-scoped history normalization: hook-injected
  context moves after an unambiguous tool-call/result batch. Parallel calls remain grouped before
  their matching outputs so every call stays in the reasoning-bearing assistant turn. Tolerant
  providers and ambiguous duplicate, missing, or out-of-order call IDs keep their original input order.

- `forward` URL → `{baseUrl}/responses`. A `key` provider defaults to the legacy `{baseUrl}/v1/responses` construction.
- A `key` provider may set a validated relative `responsesPath`; the adapter removes one trailing slash from `baseUrl` and sends `{trimmedBaseUrl}{responsesPath}`. For Ark Agent Plan, use `baseUrl: "https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/plan/v3"` with `responsesPath: "/responses"`.
- In `forward` mode only a safe header allowlist is relayed (`FORWARD_HEADERS`): authorization,
  ChatGPT account id, and the OpenAI beta/originator/session headers. This is the ChatGPT-login path
  that also powers the [sidecars](/guides/sidecars/).

## Command Code session affinity

The OAuth `command-code` adapter derives an opaque `x-session-id` from the client
thread identity, then the reasoning-replay conversation identity. When neither is
available, it uses a prompt-cache key only if the integration has explicitly
classified that key as belonging to one conversation. Shared or unclassified cache
keys do not establish session affinity; requests without a usable identity receive
a fresh session ID. Recovery and cached-history replay preserve this classification.

The API-key `commandcode` provider uses Chat Completions for most model ids and the
Anthropic Messages adapter (`x-api-key`) for `claude-*` ids, which Command Code serves
only on `/provider/v1/messages`; the pin applies only while the provider points at that
endpoint. It supports forwarding `prompt_cache_key`; this is separate
from the OAuth adapter's session header and does not guarantee a provider cache hit.
The OAuth `command-code` preset streams `/alpha/generate` as NDJSON. MiMo tool-call
markup echoed by the gateway as text is removed when it duplicates a real call, including
markup the gateway appends after ordinary prose in the same chunk; a marker split across
chunks is still shown as text. Reasoning or other events arriving in between no longer
release a held envelope. After a clean stop or tool-call finish, a complete declared-tool
call with no native counterpart is restored as a real call; an interrupted or failed turn
leaves the markup as text. A call the parser cannot read is dropped rather than printed
when it still opens, closes, and names a declared tool, and either the real call for that
tool arrives or the turn finishes cleanly. A freeform call echoed without its
`</function>` close counts as complete once `</tool_call>` arrives. This applies to every
MiMo model Command Code serves.

## `anthropic`

**Targets:** Anthropic **Messages** (`/v1/messages`).
**Auth:** `key` (`x-api-key` by default, or `Authorization: Bearer` with `apiKeyTransport: "bearer"`) or `oauth` (Bearer + `anthropic-beta`, for Claude Pro/Max).

- Converts messages to Anthropic content blocks (text, base64 image, `tool_use`, `thinking`).
- Translated Anthropic Messages reasoning replay shares the request translation budget, including
  encoding/decoding copy overhead. Requests exceeding it return HTTP 413 with
  `translation_buffer_limit`; signatures and opaque reasoning data are never truncated to fit.
  Native Anthropic passthrough uses its separate body-size contract.
- **Extended thinking math:** Anthropic requires `max_tokens > thinking.budget_tokens`. The adapter
  maps reasoning effort to a budget (minimal 1024 … max 32000), then computes a safe `max_tokens` with
  output headroom, and **drops `temperature`/`top_p`** when thinking is enabled (Anthropic forbids
  them there).
- **Structured output:** Responses `text.format` and Chat Completions `response_format` requests
  with `type: "json_schema"` become Anthropic `output_config.format`. The format merges into an
  existing adaptive-thinking output configuration, preserving a compatible `output_config.effort`.
  Routed Anthropic Messages requests preserve the same format through stored-OAuth translation.
  The adapter mirrors the Anthropic TypeScript SDK's supported JSON Schema subset: unsupported
  constraints are moved into `description` as model guidance, `oneOf` becomes `anyOf`, and object
  schemas receive `additionalProperties: false`. A root `$ref` retains its adjacent `$defs` so the
  local reference remains resolvable. OpenAI envelope fields such as schema `name`, envelope
  `description`, and `strict` are not part of the Anthropic wire format. JSON object mode without a
  schema has no Anthropic equivalent and is not translated.
- Always sends `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`. Streams `content_block_delta` (`text_delta`,
  `thinking_delta`, compatible `reasoning_delta`, `input_json_delta`). The SSE decoder preserves
  event state across fetch chunks and accepts a terminal `message_stop` without a trailing newline.
- For routed Anthropic Responses turns with client tools, a bounded terminal guard detects the
  high-confidence case where the user requested an action but Claude ends with an execution claim
  and no tool call. It performs at most one internal continuation; normal answers, clarification
  questions, tool-using turns, and transport-incomplete responses are not auto-retried.

## `google`

**Targets:** Google **Gemini**, **Vertex AI**, and Antigravity **Cloud Code Assist**. AI Studio uses
`/v1beta/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent`; the other modes use their native Google endpoints.
**Auth:** API key, Vertex ADC, or Google Antigravity OAuth, selected by `googleMode`.

- **Location denials are permission errors, not invalid requests.** Google rejects unsupported
  geographic or datacenter locations with HTTP 400 `FAILED_PRECONDITION: User location is not
  supported for the API use.` The proxy reports this as `… location not supported: …` and
  classifies it as `permission_error` with code `location_not_supported`, so a client does not
  misread a network-location refusal as a malformed prompt. The direct HTTP response keeps the
  upstream 400; message-only terminal paths infer 403 (permission class). The restriction itself
  is Google's — the proxy does not route around it.
- System prompt → `systemInstruction`; messages → `contents[]` (assistant → `model`); tools →
  `functionDeclarations`. Data-URL images → `inline_data`.
- Tool-call ids are synthesized when Gemini omits them. Vertex and Antigravity preserve and replay
  opaque `thoughtSignature` values so tool-result continuations retain Gemini reasoning continuity.
  The signature cache is snapshotted to the config directory, so continuations also survive proxy
  restarts.
- **Malformed response shapes fail closed.** A claimed candidate, its `content`, or its
  `content.parts` that is not the documented container terminates the turn with a
  `google response contained invalid …` error naming the structural reason and the offending
  value's type — never its contents. Absence is handled separately from corruption: an absent,
  `null` or empty `content` or `parts` still completes the turn normally, a streaming chunk whose
  `candidates` is absent, `null` or empty is skipped so the turn completes on a later terminal
  frame, and a buffered response that carries no candidate at all returns
  `google response contained no candidates`. A root `data: null` keepalive frame is still skipped as
  padding.
- Tool-call batches are closed by one immediately adjacent user turn containing one ordered
  `functionResponse` per representable call. Interrupted histories receive an explicit missing-result marker;
  duplicate or standalone results are preserved as marked text (and image siblings) rather than
  emitted as invalid unpaired `functionResponse` parts.
- **Inline image output:** when the model is one of the explicit image-capable chat IDs
  (`gemini-3.1-flash-image`, `gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation`, or
  `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`), the adapter sends `responseModalities: ["TEXT", "IMAGE"]`.
  Standalone media-generation IDs such as `gemini-3-pro-image` are not included. Returned
  `inlineData` parts are materialized under the configured OpenCodex `artifacts/` directory and
  surfaced as markdown image links to the authenticated opaque route
  `/v1/opencodex/artifacts/<id>` (not `file:` URIs or host filesystem paths). Each image is capped
  at 50 MB and each response at 100 MB of decoded data; malformed base64 payloads are rejected.
  Artifacts are pruned automatically when the count exceeds 200 files.

## `kiro`

**Targets:** the Amazon CodeWhisperer Streaming `GenerateAssistantResponse` service used by Kiro
(`https://runtime.{region}.kiro.dev/`).
**Auth:** Kiro OAuth access token as Bearer, with region/profile metadata from the Kiro credential.

- Builds Kiro `conversationState`, maps Codex tools and tool results, and sends image blocks supported
  by the Kiro wire.
- Coalesces adjacent outputs from the same original tool call into one Kiro result. Text remains
  ordered, images retain the existing per-message limits, and any error flag remains set. User,
  developer, assistant or another tool's output ends the group. Distinct original IDs that map
  to the same normalized Kiro ID are rejected.
- Combined outputs keep real text and failure information without inserting an empty-output hint
  for a later blank chunk. A single result keeps its existing normalization; an entirely text-empty
  group receives one fallback, with neutral wording when images or an error flag are present.
- Treats a client `parallel_tool_calls: true` value as permission rather than a wire requirement.
  Kiro remains serialized: the routed catalog advertises no parallel-tool capability and the
  adapter sends no parallel-control field upstream, but ordinary Codex tool turns are not rejected
  solely because the client permits parallel calls.
- Accepts Responses `text` controls that are not structured output — `text.verbosity` and
  `text.format: {"type":"text"}` — without forwarding them. Kiro has no wire field for either, so
  they are ignored rather than rejected. Structured output (`text.format` of type `json_schema`
  or `json_object`) is still refused: the Kiro wire cannot constrain the response shape, and a
  caller expecting JSON would otherwise receive prose.
- Decodes `application/vnd.amazon.eventstream`, reconstructs text/thinking/tool events, detects
  truncated tool JSON, and estimates usage because the upstream does not return token counts.
- Uses the configured `baseUrl` verbatim when it is custom. A canonical
  `runtime.{region}.kiro.dev` URL follows the imported credential's API region; only that canonical
  shape is eligible for one bounded fallback to `q.{region}.amazonaws.com` after an endpoint,
  signature, DNS, or connection failure.
- Owns replay-safe connection-reset recovery, that single eligible endpoint fallback, one OAuth
  refresh/replay after HTTP 401, and bounded recovery for transient Kiro 429s. A shared cooldown and
  single post-cooldown probe prevent concurrent requests from exhausting independent retry budgets;
  hard quota failures and ordinary service errors are not replayed.
- Its non-streaming parser drains the same event stream for the web-search loop.
- Reports per-account usage. `AmazonCodeWhispererService.GetUsageLimits` on
  `https://management.{region}.kiro.dev/` returns the plan allowance, which becomes the
  monthly quota window for that account; a free-trial balance is reported as its own window.
  The region comes from the account's profile ARN, then its stored API/SSO region. An
  unreadable or unrecognised response is reported as unknown rather than as zero usage, and
  an account whose overage is enabled is not treated as exhausted merely for passing its
  limit. The operation is undocumented by AWS, so treat the numbers as best-effort.
- Participates in multi-account rotation. Two or more logged-in Kiro accounts enable
  automatic failover on a 429, and rotation prefers the account with the most known
  headroom; an account whose allowance is provably spent is cooled until its window resets
  (bounded between five minutes and a day) instead of being retried every minute. Each
  rotated bearer carries its own profile ARN and region.

### Completion semantics

Kiro assistant text carries no dependable end-turn phase of its own. Its terminal `metadataEvent`
can carry a native `stopReason`, but Kiro can label progress prose as `END_TURN`. On tool-enabled
turns, `END_TURN` and `STOP_SEQUENCE` therefore prove only that the inference stopped; ordinary text
remains commentary and enters the one bounded completion validation.

`END_TURN`, `STOP_SEQUENCE`, or a missing stop reason may use the compatibility path. Other explicit
reasons have already terminated the inference upstream, so the adapter reports them instead of
spending another model request: an output-token limit surfaces as incomplete output that a client may continue, while
context-window exhaustion surfaces as a non-retryable context-length error rather than as truncated
output. Filtering and guardrail stops surface as filtered incomplete output, and a `TOOL_USE` stop
that arrives without an actual tool call is reported as a contradiction rather than treated as
progress.

When an ordinary client tool exists, opencodex adds a private
`codex_kiro_final_answer` tool to the upstream request; progress text streams as commentary and
cannot terminate the turn. The adapter consumes the private call, emits its answer as final text,
and never exposes the private tool to Codex or Claude Code. Because the stop reason only arrives at
the end of the stream, assistant text in a tool-enabled turn is held until either a real tool call
starts or the stream ends, then releases it as commentary unless the private tool supplied the final
answer. When the web-search sidecar is active, released
commentary still streams ahead of the terminal event; only the events needed to decide whether the
model requested a synthetic search remain buffered.

A question the model cannot proceed without is also a final answer. The injected contract tells a
routed model that when it needs a decision, a piece of information, or a clarification only the user
can give, it should deliver that question through `codex_kiro_final_answer` and stop, rather than
writing the question as ordinary text and continuing. Such a turn arrives like any other completed
answer: final text with the turn ended, not commentary and not a client tool call. Without this,
the contract described only "still working" and "fully complete", and a model holding a blocking
question had no way to say so — the observed result was a question and a self-override emitted as one
message, followed by another tool call from the same inference.

If Kiro stops without calling the completion tool, the adapter makes one continuation. Reasoning-
only retries preserve the original valid user/tool-result turn rather than manufacturing an empty
assistant message; visible progress is replayed with a non-empty adapter-owned instruction. Before
transport, the generated conversation is checked for alternating roles, non-empty structural turns,
and matched tool-use/result ids. Empty tool output receives a neutral non-empty placeholder. The
retry cannot recurse: an empty or reasoning-only retry is returned as retryable incomplete, while a
real client tool call keeps the turn open. A completion-tool answer is always emitted as
`final_answer`, even when it exactly repeats prior commentary, because phase correctness is more
important than cosmetic de-duplication. Tool-free requests retain normal text completion behavior.

### Reasoning effort

The GPT-5.6 family uses `additionalModelRequestFields.reasoning.effort`; `claude-opus-5`
uses `additionalModelRequestFields.output_config.effort`. For `gpt-5.6-luna` and
`gpt-5.6-terra`, only `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `max` use the verified native path.
Their `xhigh` selection retains the previous bounded thinking instructions in user content
because that native rung has not been verified. `gpt-5.6-sol` and `claude-opus-5` keep
their existing native `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` behavior. Other Kiro
models use emulated reasoning; an advertised effort control is not proof of native support.

## `cursor`

**Targets:** Cursor's `agent.v1.AgentService/Run` over HTTP/2 Connect streaming at `api2.cursor.sh`
by default. With `upstreamHttpVersion: "http1.1"` (or `"h1"`), uses Cursor's HTTP/1.1
compatibility pair: `agent.v1.AgentService/RunSSE` for server output and
`aiserver.v1.BidiService/BidiAppend` for client messages.
**Auth:** Cursor OAuth/access token from `provider.apiKey` or the forwarded authorization header.

- Uses `runTurn` rather than the ordinary fetch/parse path. Requests, server events, tool arguments,
  usage checkpoints, and client replies are encoded with `@bufbuild/protobuf` schemas in
  `cursor/gen/agent_pb.ts` and framed as Connect messages.
- Replays conversation state through content-addressed blobs, maps server tool calls back to Codex,
  discovers live Cursor models through the protobuf `GetUsableModels` RPC, and retries only before a
  run request is committed to the wire.
- After a successful no-tool turn, the adapter keeps Cursor's returned ConversationStateStructure
  in a process-local store and reuses that checkpoint on the next validated linear continuation
  instead of rebuilding the full root history. Tool-result turns reuse the last completed-turn
  checkpoint plus only the uncovered suffix when the covered message boundary is known.
  Ref-less prefix lookup requires a remembered Cursor conversation or stable client thread
  (including the bounded Desktop session/thread fallback) and a checkpoint owned by that same
  provider conversation; otherwise it full-replays.
  Compaction, helper/shadow isolation, account/model mismatch, missing refs, decode failures,
  forced-fresh recovery, and invalid_argument retries fall back to the existing full replay. A
  process restart drops the in-memory store and full-replays. Cursor Connect still does not expose
  authoritative cache_read_tokens, so OpenCodex usage is not a cache-hit counter.
  The bounded Desktop fallback stores only a process-local HMAC-derived owner; raw session/thread
  headers and OAuth/authorization material are never written to checkpoint state. Cursor's
  OAuth-backed live transport and account-filtered model discovery remain experimental; see the
  [provider guide](/guides/providers/) and [Cursor provider configuration](/reference/configuration/providers/#cursor-provider-adapter-cursor)
  for login and transport settings. Checkpoint reuse itself is automatic and has no user setting.
- External-model tool continuations keep the latest actual user request in the active action;
  automatic summaries and standalone ambient-browser context remain historical context.
  Blank or image-only user input does not revive an older request. Grok 4.6 code-mode guidance
  requires explicit result emission and never assumes an empty completed cell emitted output.
  Missing output calls for a read-only state check, not replay of a completed side effect.
  Repetition advice resets on a new user/developer turn and permits requested polling.
  If carried checkpoint roots exceed the replay
  budget, available history is rebuilt under the same limits. These repairs do not guarantee
  identical wording or reasoning behavior between Cursor and xAI routes.
- Honors `upstreamHttpVersion` for both live model discovery and inference. `auto`, `http2`, and `h2`
  preserve the existing HTTP/2 transport; only `http1.1` and `h1` select compatibility mode.
- Exposes Cursor Router as `cursor/auto` plus explicit `cursor/auto-cost`,
  `cursor/auto-balance`, and `cursor/auto-intelligence` entries. Explicit levels are encoded in
  `requested_model.parameters` while the legacy `cursor/auto` entry retains the account/team default.
- Sends regular `cursor/grok-4.5` tiers with Cursor's exact live-discovery wire ids
  (`cursor-grok-4.5-low`, `-medium`, or `-high`). Keeps `cursor/grok-4.5-fast` selectable while
  sending the canonical `grok-4.5` model with separate `effort` and `fast=true` parameters.
- Cursor-native local filesystem/shell/network execution is denied by default. Explicit `mcpServers`
  and `desktopExecutor` integrations have separate opt-ins; `nativeLocalExec: "on"` enables the
  broader built-in executor and bypasses Codex approval/sandbox semantics, and legacy
  `unsafeAllowNativeLocalExec: true` remains equivalent only when `nativeLocalExec` is unset.
  Foreground `shellArgs` and `shellStreamArgs` are an exception: both are rejected before spawn
  on every platform until kernel-backed descendant ownership is available. Use client shell tools;
  background-shell execution and other native operations retain their existing policy.
- The denial reply is a silent redirect whose wording follows the request catalog. A catalog that
  carries `shell_command`/`exec_command` or a unified `exec` keeps the bridge wording; a catalog
  that carries neither — an orchestrator client exposing only its own Responses tools, for example —
  is redirected to the request's actual wire names, so the model is pointed at a tool that exists
  rather than at an alias it cannot see.
- A recognized Cursor data-policy gate is reported with its title, the action it requires, and the
  Cursor Dashboard review URL instead of a bare `failed_precondition: Error`. Recognition is limited
  to the known structured detail: unknown or malformed details keep the generic Connect error, no
  upstream text, button, URL, or consent action is forwarded or executed, and the failure stays
  non-retryable. Reviewing and accepting a data policy remains a user action in Cursor itself.

Codex-compatible shell schemas retain sandbox permissions, justification, reusable
prefix rules and login mode. Freeform tools expose one required string `input`
and preserve its tool-specific guidance, such as the required patch envelope;
bare `exec_command` and `shell_command` names are reserved for non-freeform shell
bridges. Namespace a custom freeform tool that uses either name. These schema
declarations do not grant approval or change execution policy.

## `devin`

**Targets:** Cognition's `exa.api_server_pb.ApiServerService/GetChatMessage` over HTTPS Connect
streaming at `server.codeium.com`.
**Auth:** Devin/Cognition API key from `provider.apiKey` or the forwarded authorization header.
Login first tries to import the credential the installed Devin CLI already holds: `devin auth
login` completes the CLI's own PKCE sign-in and writes a `devin-session-token` to its
`credentials.toml`, which is the same credential `SeatManagementService.RegisterUser` mints for a
browser sign-in. When no usable CLI credential exists, login falls back to Auth0 browser sign-in
and exchanges the pasted token via `RegisterUser` for a long-lived API key. `devin-cli` survives
only as a deprecated alias — `ocx login devin-cli` still routes to `devin`, and a saved
configuration that names the old id is rewritten at startup.

- Uses `runTurn` rather than the ordinary fetch/parse path. Requests and server events are encoded
  with manual protobuf framing in `devin/cloud-direct/wire.ts`; the ordinary `buildRequest` /
  `parseStream` path is disabled.
- Live model discovery via `GetCascadeModelConfigs`; the static seed is filtered against the
  account's live roster so models not on the plan drop out instead of failing at request time.
- Tool definitions are encoded in the request and tool-call events are decoded from the response
  stream. Cognition enforces a per-tool-description length limit (6,998 chars) and an exact-phrase
  blocklist; the adapter sanitizes known triggers and truncates over-long descriptions before
  encoding.
- Devin/Cognition API keys do not refresh. Run `ocx login devin` again when the key expires or is
  revoked.
- Only the credential is local when the CLI import path is used. The turn itself goes to
  Cognition either way, so the import and browser login paths differ in nothing but where the
  credential came from. Install the CLI with
  `curl -fsSL https://cli.devin.ai/install.sh | bash` or `brew install --cask devin-cli`, run
  `devin auth login` once, then add the provider.
- An earlier build shipped a second adapter under the id `devin-cli` that ran the turn as an
  Agent Client Protocol session against a local `devin acp` child process. It is gone. A saved
  configuration that still names that adapter is rewritten to `devin` at startup, including a
  custom-named row such as `"devin-acp"`.
- The chat request is calibrated, not guessed. Three things gate it together: the credential is the
  session token doubled and dash-joined in an `Authorization: Basic` header while the protobuf body
  keeps one copy, the request envelope goes up uncompressed, and `Metadata` #31 carries a
  732-character device fingerprint whose length — not value — the service checks. Inside
  `CompletionConfiguration`, #2 is the output cap and #3 is the context window; swapping those two
  makes every turn fail with an opaque `invalid_argument`. A temperature of exactly 0 is refused, so
  it is clamped to the smallest accepted value.
- A pre-output 429 that states a recovery delay is retried in place only when the full stated
  delay fits within the remaining cumulative wait allowance. The adapter waits that full delay
  and replays the request up to twice; the default cumulative allowance is 30 minutes
  (`OPENCODEX_DEVIN_STATED_RESET_WAIT_MS`, hard ceiling one hour). If the delay exceeds the
  remaining allowance, the original 429 is surfaced without waiting or replaying. Retrying
  earlier than the stated delay is deliberately not attempted — the hint is the provider's best
  estimate of its own window, and each replay slot is finite. If the limit still refuses, the
  final 429 surfaces to the client with the stated delay preserved as its cooldown hint. A `~`
  in the surfaced message marks a delay recovered from a secondhand trailer sentence rather
  than an exact header value; clients still receive the parsed number itself.
- Experimental unofficial bridge; not shown in the dashboard preset by default. See the
  [provider guide](/guides/providers/) for login instructions.

For SWE-2, an explicit reasoning effort overrides an effort suffix in the model
id. For example, `swe-2-high` with `medium` selects the native `swe-2-medium` UID;
`xhigh`, `ultra`, and `max` select `swe-2-max`. Values below Medium select Medium
and do not disable SWE-2 reasoning. Without an explicit effort, a suffixed model
id is preserved. This applies through the shared adapter to every Devin account,
whichever login path minted the credential; other model families keep their
existing suffix precedence.

## `azure-openai` (alias: `azure`)

**Targets:** **Azure OpenAI**. Wraps `openai-responses` (so also `passthrough: true`).
**Auth:** `key` via the `api-key` header (not Bearer).

- Delegates request building to the Responses passthrough, validates that `baseUrl` contains no
  unresolved template placeholder, and replaces `Authorization` with `api-key`. The configured URL
  targets Azure's v1 Responses API directly, so the adapter does not append `api-version`.
- Shares the Responses recovery for reasoning state another provider produced: after a
  `400 invalid_encrypted_content` it resends once without that state. See
  [Proxy formats](/reference/proxy-formats/) under "Switching providers in an existing conversation".

## Image utilities (`image.ts`)

Shared helpers used by the vision-aware adapters:

- `parseDataUrl(url)` — split a `data:<type>;base64,<data>` URL into `{ mediaType, base64 }` for
  Anthropic/Google image blocks.
- `contentPartsToText(content)` — flatten content parts to text for text-only tool messages
  (an undescribed image becomes a short `[image]` marker, never a token-exploding base64 blob).

## Grok Build terminal snapshots

Requests marked with `x-opencodex-grok: 1` opt into a narrow Responses terminal
repair. If `response.completed.response.output` is missing or empty, opencodex
can reconstruct it from real, uniquely indexed, contiguous `output_item.done`
items whose raw fields satisfy the supported shapes. Deltas alone do not create
output. Malformed, contradictory, duplicated, gapped or oversized evidence keeps
the empty terminal unchanged; failed and incomplete responses never become success.

The marker is a client-selected compatibility option, not authenticated identity
or a permission grant. Unmarked clients retain their existing behavior. This
repair runs before the separate provider `responsesSnapshotRepair` option and
does not enable that broader lifecycle repair. Existing tool-search, custom-tool,
function-completion and undeclared-tool handling keep their established order.
