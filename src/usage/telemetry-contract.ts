/**
 * The telemetry vocabulary both the proxy and the dashboard read.
 *
 * This module has NO imports, and that is its entire job. The dashboard is a separate TypeScript
 * project with `erasableSyntaxOnly`, and a type-only import still pulls the imported file's whole
 * import graph into that project. Importing these names from `./log` therefore dragged
 * `node:fs`, `node:crypto` and the config barrel into the browser build, where a parameter
 * property in `src/config/atomic-write.ts` fails to compile. The names below are the ones a
 * browser legitimately needs, so they live where a browser can reach them.
 *
 * Anything added here must stay free of imports. A contract that acquires a dependency stops
 * being a contract.
 */

/**
 * Recovery kinds recorded per attempt in the usage log; the dashboard renders localized labels
 * for these wire values.
 *
 * The roster is the single statement of this vocabulary and the type is derived from it. It was
 * written twice once -- as a union and as the read-back whitelist -- and the two are not
 * interchangeable: a member added only to the union compiles, is written to disk, and is dropped
 * on the next read, so the row loses the field that says why it recovered. One declaration cannot
 * drift from itself, and the dashboard now reads this one rather than keeping a third copy.

 * to the service log under both launchd and systemd, so an installed service ends up with a

 * also fingerprinted each payload under a process-global random key, which makes every repeated
 * prompt fragment, tool name and error message correlatable for the process lifetime.

 * partial output size -- and cannot carry content at all. They ride the attempt, so they inherit
