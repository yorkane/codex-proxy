/**
 * #2460 — `responses-state.json` was rewritten in full on a fixed 2 s debounce.
 *
 * The snapshot is bounded at 24 MiB, so under sustained traffic every debounce
 * paid a complete re-serialization plus an atomic replacement of a file nothing
 * reads until the next start. Two narrow measures are covered here: a
 * byte-identical payload is not rewritten, and the debounce scales with the size
 * of the snapshot actually being written.
