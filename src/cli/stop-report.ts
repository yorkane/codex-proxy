/**
 * Structured summary for `ocx stop --json` (D4 of the app runtime ownership unit).
 *
 * The desktop shell drives the real `ocx stop` as a child process so the receipt-backed
 * teardown, the drain, the Windows respawn verification and the client-config restore run
 * exactly as they do from a terminal. This module makes that run's RESULT readable from
 * outside: a StopRunRecord is threaded through the existing stop path in
 * src/cli/index.ts (the same booleans that already decide the exit code), and
 * summarizeStopRun turns it into one versioned JSON document.
 *
 * Nothing here re-decides anything. If a field of the record is wrong, the fix belongs
 * in the stop path, not in the summarizer.
