/**
 * Ownership receipt for a deferred shared teardown (#3008).
 *
 * `ocx stop` asks the proxy NOT to restore native Codex and the Grok fence, because a
 * stopped Task Scheduler can respawn the proxy and a survivor must keep its client
 * config. That hands one obligation to the parent — and a bare query flag cannot express
 * an obligation: if the parent dies between the child's exit and its own restore, the
 * shared config keeps pointing at a proxy that is gone, with nothing on disk saying so.
 *
 * The receipt is that missing state. The parent writes it BEFORE asking for a deferred
 * stop and removes it only after its own restore, so a later `ocx stop`/`ocx update` can
 * see the abandoned obligation and finish it once that proxy is proven down.
 *
 * ## Why the nonce is the FILENAME
 *
 * One shared file cannot be cleared safely. Read-compare-unlink is three syscalls, and a
 * concurrent stop replacing the file between the compare and the unlink means this run
 * deletes an obligation it never owned — the check passed against bytes that are already
 * gone. Giving each claim its own path removes the race rather than serializing it:
 * `unlink` names one specific obligation, so it can only ever delete that one. Two
 * concurrent stops hold two receipts, which is the truth of the situation.
