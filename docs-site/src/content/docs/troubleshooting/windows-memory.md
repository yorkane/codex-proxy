title: Windows Memory Growth
description: Why the bun process can grow to many gigabytes of RAM on Windows, what opencodex does about it today, and your options until the upstream Bun fixes ship.
---

Some Windows users see the `bun` process behind opencodex grow to many
gigabytes of RSS during long streaming sessions (reported as issue
[#314](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/issues/314)). This page explains
what is actually happening and what you can do about it, honestly.

## Root cause: upstream Bun runtime issues

opencodex bundles the Bun runtime (currently **1.3.14**). The memory growth is
driven by known upstream Bun issues, not by JavaScript-level leaks in the
proxy:

| Bun issue | State (checked 2026-07-23) |
|---|---|
| [#28035](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/28035) — `fetch()` receive backpressure not coupled to JS consumption | Fixed by [PR #29831](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/29831); **which release carries it is unverified** — we assume the bundled 1.3.14 does not |
| [#32111](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/32111) — crash when a client aborts an async-pull stream | Fix [PR #32120](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/32120) merged 2026-06-21; not assumed present in 1.3.14. Note: this crash is **not Windows-specific** (it also reproduced on macOS/Linux) |
| [PR #31654](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/31654) — `node:net` socket handle leak | Still **open** upstream |

On Windows, opencodex must keep streaming responses on a conservative code
path to avoid the #32111 crash, and that path is the one most exposed to the
backpressure issue: a slow or stalled client can leave the runtime buffering
upstream data in native memory that JavaScript cannot bound.

## What opencodex does today

Bounded mitigation and visibility — **not a fix**. On the bundled 1.3.14
runtime the leak itself remains an upstream problem:

- **Memory watchdog** — the proxy samples its own memory every minute and logs a
  rate-limited warning when observed memory crosses 4 GiB. Observed memory is
  the largest of RSS, `external`, and `arrayBuffers` (not their sum), because
  Windows working-set/RSS counters can under-report committed external
  retention.
- **`ocx doctor`** — a "Memory / runtime" section shows the *service*
  process's Bun version, RSS, external/ArrayBuffers counters, JS-heap context,
  and stream-mode decision. On the bundled Bun 1.3.14 runtime, `heapUsed` /
  `jscHeap` alone are not a leak discriminator; compare observed memory with
  `responseState` and repeated samples before assigning an app-level leak.
- **`GET /api/system/memory`** — the same data over the authenticated
  management API for dashboards or scripts. Alongside RSS/heap/external counters
  it reports a scalar `responseState` block (entry count, total/largest
  serialized bytes, oldest-entry age) for the proxy's in-memory
  `previous_response_id` continuation store. This further attributes growth: a
  rising `responseState.totalBytes` under rising observed memory points at
  conversation retention (long `store:false` chains re-expanding each turn),
  whereas a flat `responseState` under rising observed memory points away from
  that store. The values are scalar-only — no request bodies, tokens, paths, or
  account identifiers — and the read is side-effect free (it never prunes or
  evicts). Spill-write health is reported separately inside that block:
  `spillWriteStatus` starts as `initial`, becomes `degraded` after a failed
  publication, and returns to `healthy` after the next successful publication.
  `spillWriteConsecutiveFailures`, the last failure time, and the last success
  time show whether failures are accumulating or recovering in the same process.
  The last failure is a fixed privacy-safe class such as `EACCES`, `ENOSPC`,
  `ETIMEDOUT`, or `EACLRETRYEXHAUSTED`; raw error messages and filesystem paths
  are never returned. `spillLastWriteFailureOrigin` adds a fixed origin or null:
  `retry_returned_timeout` means the existing second spill attempt returned a
  timeout; `timeout_memo_refusal` means the ACL helper refused through its
  remembered timeout state. Other failures use null. The cumulative
  `spillAclRetryReturnedTimeouts` and `spillAclTimeoutMemoRefusals` count terminal
  failed publications, not individual ACL commands or transient first attempts.
  Success clears the failure streak but retains the last failure fields and
  cumulative counts; a later unrelated failure sets the last origin to null.
  These values are process-local, so compare snapshots from the same process.
  Neither origin identifies an OS command: the attempt budget can expire before
  a command starts, and an optional compliance inspection can run before a memo
  refusal. A separate process succeeding does not prove that the live process's
  memo recovered. These observations do not add retries, clear memos, weaken
  required ACLs, or automatically restart the service.

  These diagnostics stay on the authenticated management
  endpoint and are intentionally absent from `/healthz`, which remains a liveness
  signal. The dashboard's **Memory observability** card renders the memory and
  continuation-size fields from this endpoint and offers a confirm-gated
  **Drain & restart** action: it shows
  the current active-turn count, waits up to 60s for active turns (reusing
  the existing 503 + `Retry-After` drain), then aborts any remaining turns.
  The running proxy owns restart authorization and drain coordination, then
  exits; an installed service manager launches the replacement when applicable.
  The action reports success only after a different, identity-verified process
  is healthy on the same port, without tearing down Codex injection. That is a
  longer, informed recycle than the short drain on `POST /api/stop`.

  For a scriptable snapshot of the complete authenticated payload, run
  `ocx observe memory --json`; the CLI forwards the same response-state fields.
- **A gated alternative stream path** — a bounded single-reader relay that
  removes the unbounded buffering shape entirely. On Windows it becomes the
  default automatically once a bundled Bun release verifiably carries the
  #32111 fix; today it is opt-in only (see below). On macOS it stays opt-in
  even after such a release — flipping macOS `auto` is a separate decision.

Real-world RSS improvement from these changes is **awaiting verification by
Windows users** — we do not claim the leak is fixed.

Threshold-based auto-restart is deliberately **not** shipped. If the process
crashes, the service managers (Task Scheduler/WinSW, launchd, systemd) already
restart it.

## Your options

1. **Wait for a bundled runtime update.** Once a Bun release verifiably
   carries the fixes, opencodex will bump the bundled runtime and the safer
   stream path turns on automatically on Windows (macOS keeps requiring the
   explicit opt-in below).

2. **Run a Bun runtime you trust with `OPENCODEX_BUN_PATH`.** This is
   unvalidated territory — you are running opencodex on a runtime we have not
   tested; at your own risk. Important for service installs: the override is
   read **when the service artifact is generated**, not at service start. Set
   the environment variable, then re-run `ocx service repair` from that same
   shell so the path is baked into the durable service definition. Setting
   the env alone does nothing for an already-installed service.

3. **Opt into the bounded relay with `streamMode: "eager-relay"`.** Two ways:
   edit `config.json` (add `"streamMode": "eager-relay"`), or call the
   management API — a `PUT /api/settings` with `{"streamMode":"eager-relay"}`
   applies to new turns without a restart. **Crash risk warning:** on Bun
   1.3.14 this uses the stream shape affected by #32111, which can crash the
   process mid-stream (on any OS, not just Windows). The service manager will
   restart it, but in-flight requests fail. `"legacy-tee"` pins the current
   default. On Windows, `"auto"` (default) lets the runtime gate decide. On
   macOS, `"auto"` always stays on tee; explicit `"eager-relay"` is the opt-in.

If you try any of these on a real Windows workload, please report the before
and after `ocx doctor` memory sections on
[#314](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/issues/314) — that is exactly
the verification this mitigation is waiting on.
