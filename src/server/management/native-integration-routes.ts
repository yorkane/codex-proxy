 * Toggle routes for the integrations that are NOT file-merged clients.
 *
 * The six file clients live in `integration-routes.ts` and go through
 * `src/integrations/writer.ts`, which merges config fragments and journals every
 * write. These do not: Claude Code is a flag in our own config, and Grok owns a
 * fenced region of a file we do not otherwise write. Neither has a merged
 * fragment to own, so neither needs a snapshot, a journal row, or a restore
 * route — turning them back on is the undo.
 *
 * That conclusion cost eleven audit rounds; the reasoning is in
 * devlog/_fin/260803_integrations_toggle_all/, and 007 records why Codex and
 * Claude Desktop are NOT here: their state spans several artifacts and a live
 * database, so they need a durable operation record this module deliberately
 * does not have.
 *
 * Design of record: devlog/_fin/260803_integrations_toggle_all/030 (routes),
 * 011 (Claude Code), 012 (Grok).
