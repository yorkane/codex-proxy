# Credits

When a maintainer lands another author's pull request by reimplementing,
carrying, or rebasing it, the resulting commit is authored by the maintainer.
The contributor's name survives only through a `Co-authored-by` trailer — that
trailer is what GitHub reads for the contributor graph, the repository's
contributor list, and the author's own profile activity.

Some of those landings carry the trailer. Others state the debt in the commit
body and omit it:

```
  53c09a247  "Clean reimplementation of #3193"   Co-authored-by: alan7629 ...
  5734a1caf  "Reimplements #2797 by @rrmlima."   (no contributor trailer)
```

Both sentences are equally sincere. Only the first is data.

The commits below are inside published release tags and behind branch rulesets
that block force-pushes, so the trailers cannot be added retroactively without
invalidating every tag and clone —
[`MAINTAINERS.md`](./MAINTAINERS.md) states the same principle in the other
direction: authorship credit in git history is not rewritten. This file is the
forward repair.

Every entry cites the maintainer's own words from the closing comment, pull-request
description, or landing commit. Nothing here is inferred from a diff.

This file is **not** a contributor list. Most contributions merged normally,
with authorship intact, and need no entry. Absence from this page means the
ordinary path worked.

### 2026-09-07 follow-up: unlinked trailers

These commits contain a contributor name, but GitHub's commit-author mapping
does not resolve that trailer to the source PR author. No personal addresses
are reproduced here. The forward correction uses account-linked noreply identities.

| Pull request | Author | Landed as | What landed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#2817](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/2817) | [@gulup](https://github.com/gulup) | [`6fe46312c`](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/commit/6fe46312cd509bbef0e79025181e7ab6fc285681) | [The opt-in upstream Responses WebSocket transport and six carried commits.](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/3216) |

The correction commit records these contributors and the earlier **Carried work**
authors as co-authors. This is forward attribution: the old commit objects,
their original dates and release tags are unchanged.

### 2026-09-07 follow-up: four-track source-to-landing attribution

At the owner's request, this audit makes the original PR titles, authors and
delivered slices explicit for the four follow-up tracks after #3771. All linked
landing commits are ancestors of `5759d9ea2f1e7281cdc01eb9628f2e0a123fb59c`.
The human contributors already resolve through reachable source commits or merge
trailers; a merge commit with no repeated trailer does not erase its parents'
authorship. This forward record strengthens discoverability without claiming that
every earlier landing omitted credit or rewriting existing commits and tags.

The source commits for @yansigit also credit Yumi. That original automation
attribution remains in the reachable history; this audit does not invent a GitHub
account mapping for its unlinked automation identity. The forward human trailers
use the source authors' verified numeric GitHub account identities.

A delivered slice is not a statement that every requirement in its original PR
or umbrella issue is complete. The table deliberately retains the unadopted scope.

## Report and diagnosis

These fixes exist because of the report. The branch's own approach was not the
vehicle, and each author was told why at the time — recording them as carried
code would misstate what happened in the other direction.

### Four-track reports and diagnostic evidence

These issue authors supplied the reports or observations used by the follow-up
work. They are acknowledged as reporters, separately from the carried PR authors.

Diagnostic-only delivery does not establish that the reported runtime failure
has been resolved.

## Closed as landed, carry not stated

Two more were closed with a landing commit and nothing further. The landing is
recorded; what was taken is not, and inventing an answer would be the same
inaccuracy this file exists to correct.

- [#3020](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/3020) by
  [@luvs01](https://github.com/luvs01) — closed "Landed via #3119 at `a73a4c998`".
- [#2675](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/2675) by
  [@Ingwannu](https://github.com/Ingwannu) — closed "Landed via #2677 at `8412fe156`".

Two further source PRs were closed with a landing reference but without an
explicit statement of what was carried. Their authors are acknowledged here;
they are not counted as carried code solely from that closure:

- [#2360](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/2360) by
  [@chilung-cgu](https://github.com/chilung-cgu) —
  [closed as landed via #2371](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/2360#issuecomment-5379638729)
  at `ae05672e3`.
- [#3621](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/3621) by
  [@yansigit](https://github.com/yansigit) —
  [closed as landed via #3622](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/3621#issuecomment-5549370301)
  at `1505cb196`.

## How this stays accurate

This page is a repair, not a process. The process is
`missing_coauthor_credit` in
[`.github/scripts/pr-hygiene.cjs`](./.github/scripts/pr-hygiene.cjs): a pull
request whose own text says it reimplements, supersedes, carries, or rebases
another author's pull request fails the hygiene gate until a
`Co-authored-by` trailer names that author. New entries here should be
unnecessary.

If you find a landing that belongs on this page, open an issue. Being missed is
the defect this file documents, not a claim you have to argue for.

### A gap the gate does not close

The gate checks that a trailer is **present**. It cannot check that the trailer
resolves to the account it names.

A 2026-09-04 backlog review found carry PR
[#3374](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/3374), carrying
[#3333](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/3333) by
[@blackjune67](https://github.com/blackjune67), with:

```
Co-authored-by: hajune <contributor@work-domain.example.test>
```

(The address is masked here — `privacy:scan` blocks real contributor emails in the
tree. What matters is its shape: a personal work address, not a GitHub-linked one.)

That is the git identity on the contributor's own commits, so it looks correct
in every review. But GitHub attributes co-authors by **account-linked** email,
and that address is linked to no account — so the trailer would have credited
nobody, and the contributor would have been invisible on their own patch. The
gate passed it, because a trailer was there.

It was corrected before the merge to the contributor's account-linked
`users.noreply.github.com` address, which is why there is no table row for it above.

The lesson generalizes: when carrying work, take the trailer address from the
author's GitHub account (the numeric-id `users.noreply.github.com` form is always
safe), not from the commit metadata on their branch. A contributor who commits
under a work email is the normal case, not an edge case.

### Verify the landing, not just the proposal

The 2026-09-07 audit read exactly 3,000 commits reachable from
`7d8523eed75a67f7a4a15b533744fcd0e6059aa8`, ending at
`53130de4e540fbfcf2629079effb851af54e989e`, and followed source-PR descriptions,
closure comments and GitHub commit-author mappings. Normally merged work,
credited cherry-picks, independent fixes and report-only acknowledgements were
kept distinct from the carried-work tables.

A PR description or an intermediate branch commit can contain the right trailer
and still lose it when a custom squash message replaces that text. Before
calling a carry credited, inspect the **actual landing commit**: its final
`Co-authored-by` trailer must remain present and resolve to the source author's
GitHub account. The existing presence gate alone does not establish either fact.
