title: Local Plugins
description: Load your own code into the proxy at startup to rewrite provider sends, for example to put a local compression proxy in front of providers.
---

A local plugin is a TypeScript or JavaScript file that `ocx start` loads before the proxy begins
serving. It can see every provider send just before it leaves the process and redirect it or add
headers — enough to place a local sidecar (a compression proxy, a recorder) in front of providers
without changing opencodex itself.

Plugins are local to one install. opencodex does not download, update or sign them.

## Where plugins live

Put plugin files in `plugins/` inside the opencodex home (`~/.opencodex/plugins/`, or
`$OPENCODEX_HOME/plugins/` when that variable is set):

```text
~/.opencodex/plugins/
  my-sidecar.ts
```

- Files ending in `.ts`, `.js` or `.mjs` are loaded in name order.
- Names starting with `.` or `_`, and `*.d.ts`, are ignored — rename a plugin to `_my-sidecar.ts`
  to switch it off.
- The directory is optional. Without it nothing is loaded.
- A plugin runs inside the proxy with your credentials, so opencodex refuses a plugin file or a
  `plugins/` directory that is owned by another user or writable by group or others, and refuses
  symbolic links. Every directory above `plugins/`, up to `/`, must also be owned by you or root and
  not writable by group or others, unless it is sticky like `/tmp`. Fix permissions with
  `chmod go-w ~/.opencodex/plugins ~/.opencodex/plugins/*`; on systems whose default umask is
  `002`, check the parent directories too. On macOS, an ACL grant to another user or group that
  can write, delete, change permissions, or add/remove path entries blocks loading, even if the
  mode is `0600`; inspect the path itself with `/bin/ls -lebd -- <path>`. Read-only, deny,
  inheritance-only, and grants only to the path owner or running user do not block loading. ACL
  display names such as `root` or `0` are not treated as numeric UID proof. On Linux, extended
  ACLs are checked when `getfacl` is installed. Without it, only owner and mode bits are verified.
- On Windows automatic plugin loading is disabled until an ACL trust check is available.

Restart the proxy after adding, changing or removing a plugin (`ocx service restart`, or stop and
start `ocx start`). Each loaded plugin prints a `Plugin loaded: <name>` line at startup; a skipped
plugin prints a bounded reason category. Raw plugin exception text is never printed automatically.

To start once without plugins, set `OCX_PLUGINS=0`.

## Writing a plugin

A plugin default-exports an object with an optional `name` and a `setup` function. `setup` receives a
context. An asynchronous `setup` has five seconds to finish; plugins run in the proxy's own thread, so
a `setup` that blocks synchronously cannot be interrupted and delays startup until it returns. A
`setup` that times out is not stopped either: servers or timers it already started keep running, so
start long-lived resources only after the work that can fail.

```ts
interface UpstreamTarget {
  url: string;            // absolute upstream URL; assign a new one to redirect
  headers: Headers;       // outbound headers, including credentials — never log them
  readonly transport: "http" | "websocket";
}

export default {
  name: "my-sidecar",
  setup(ctx: {
    log(message: string): void;
    registerUpstreamRewriter(rewrite: (target: UpstreamTarget) => void): void;
    onShutdown(teardown: () => void): void;
  }) {
    ctx.registerUpstreamRewriter(target => {
      const upstream = new URL(target.url);
      if (!upstream.pathname.endsWith("/chat/completions")) return;
      target.url = `http://127.0.0.1:9000${upstream.pathname}${upstream.search}`;
      target.headers.set("x-original-origin", upstream.origin);
    });
  },
};
```

The context also carries `name`, `configDir` (the opencodex home) and `pluginDir`.

Plugins cannot import opencodex modules — in the packaged binary they are not on disk. Declare the
small interfaces you need locally, as above.

## How rewrites behave

- The rewriter runs synchronously on every provider send over HTTP and on the Codex WebSocket
  connection, after opencodex has picked the transport. Keep it fast; do network checks (health
  probes) in the background and read a cached result in the rewriter.
- A send redirected to a loopback address (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`) connects directly, over
  HTTP and over the Codex WebSocket, ignoring provider proxies and `HTTP_PROXY`: a proxy elsewhere
  cannot reach this machine's loopback. Any other destination follows the normal egress settings
  (including `NO_PROXY`), evaluated against the rewritten URL, on both transports.
- The Codex WebSocket rewriter runs for every turn, before an idle pooled socket is reused, and a
  socket is only reused for the same destination and the same rewritten headers, apart from the two
  per-turn headers `x-codex-turn-state` and `x-codex-turn-metadata`. Those travel inside each
  request frame and may differ between exchanges on one socket; changes a rewriter makes to them
  are discarded. A plugin that starts or stops redirecting takes
  effect on the next turn.
- It runs after opencodex has chosen the provider, account and route, so it does not change routing,
  account selection, retries or request logs.
- A redirected send goes to the host you chose. That host sees the request exactly as the provider
  would, credentials included.
- If a rewriter throws, opencodex undoes that rewriter's edits to the send and disables it for the
  rest of the process. Edits made by rewriters that ran before it are kept, so the send goes out as
  those left it (unmodified when it is the only plugin). If `setup` throws or times out, the plugin is skipped,
  anything it registered is removed, and later registration attempts from it are ignored; other
  plugins and the proxy start normally.
- A plugin directory that exists but cannot be read (for example, wrong permissions) is reported at
  startup rather than treated as empty.
