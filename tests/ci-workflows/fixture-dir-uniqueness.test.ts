/**
 * A fixed fixture directory shared by two test files is a silent flake factory.
 *
 * `bun test --isolate` gives each file its own module registry, but every file shares one
 * process and one filesystem. Two files that delete and recreate the same path while
 * pointing OPENCODEX_HOME at it will destroy each other's config and credentials whenever
 * the suite happens to overlap them. The failure surfaces as an unrelated assertion (a 401
 * where a 400 was expected) in whichever file lost the race, and the failure count changes
 * from run to run.
 *
 * That is exactly how `.tmp-server-auth-test` came to be declared by both
 * server-auth.test.ts and management-provider-validation.test.ts: the 665b65643 split copied
 * the path literal without renaming it. Reviewers do not reliably catch a duplicated string
 * across two large files, so assert it here instead.
