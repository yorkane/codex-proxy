/**
 * #2455: a user routing gpt-5.x through the proxy asked for `service_tier: priority`,
 * saw the backend echo something else, and had no way to tell whether Fast was granted.
 *
 * The echo alone cannot answer it. The ChatGPT-internal Codex backend returns
 * `service_tier: "default"` on turns it in fact scheduled as priority, so its echo is
 * marked non-authoritative and the outcome stays `assumed` rather than being read as a
 * downgrade (#2558). That is the honest answer — but it was computed in `tierOutcome`
 * and never shown, so the tooltip printed a bare echoed value that looked like a denial.
 */

/**
 * Stub translator. The tier-outcome labels are marked with a `t:` prefix on purpose: a
 * hardcoded English label would render the same bare word as a translated one, so
 * without the marker these assertions could not tell the two apart. The real catalogs
 * are checked separately, by file, in the locale-coverage test.
