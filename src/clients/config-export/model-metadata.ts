/**
 * Modalities a given client's schema will actually accept.
 *
 * Our internal vocabulary is `text | image | audio` (ALLOWED_INPUT_MODALITIES in
 * src/server/management/model-routes.ts). Pi and Gajae accept only
 * `text | image`, and both reject the WHOLE config file over one out-of-enum
 * value — Gajae reports `/providers/opencodex/models/N/input/2: Invalid option`
 * and falls back to its built-in list, Pi returns an empty model config. So a
 * single `audio` model takes every routed model down with it. That is not
 * hypothetical: zenmux/meta-muse-spark-1.1 advertises audio and did exactly
 * this. It is also the same defect the Codex catalog had with `video`, where
 * the app showed zero apps (tests/codex-integration/catalog-input-modality-enum.test.ts).
 *
 * UNKNOWN and INCOMPATIBLE are different inputs, and the Codex fix could
 * conflate them safely only because its enum is wider. A model with nothing
 * declared is unknown, and `text` is the honest floor — every routed model takes
 * prompts. A model declaring `["audio"]` and nothing else is incompatible with a
 * text|image client, and rewriting it to `["text"]` would advertise a capability
 * it does not have. That input is reachable three ways: `ocx models add
 * --modalities audio`, `/api/custom-models`, and provider discovery.
 *
 * So unknown falls back to text and incompatible returns null, which drops the
 * row. Omitting a model costs the user a line in a picker; fabricating `text`
 * costs them a model that fails at call time with no explanation.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT applied in `ExportModel` construction: the management and CLI
 * boundaries carry catalog modalities verbatim on purpose, and stripping `audio`
 * globally would destroy valid metadata before the destination is known.
