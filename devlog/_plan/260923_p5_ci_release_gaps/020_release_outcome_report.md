# 020 — Separate release outcomes (wp2)

## Amendment after audit

The audit found that a report step inside `attach-release` can never run when `publish` fails,
because `attach-release` needs `publish`. The report is therefore its own job,
`release-outcomes`: `needs: [publish, attach-release]`, `if: always() && inputs.dry-run != true`,
`permissions: contents: read`, and it also prints both job results. Under a read token a draft
release is invisible, so the GitHub row reads `published` or `not public (draft, missing or
unreadable)`; no write permission is added to observe drafts. The sections below describe the
original step placement; the job shape above supersedes it.

## Change map

| Path | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | MODIFY — registry smoke records `npm_version` and `npm_dist_tag`; `publish` exposes them as job outputs; `attach-release` ends with an always-run report |
| `scripts/ci/release-outcome-report.sh` | NEW — writes one summary row per outcome |
| `tests/ci-workflows/release-outcome-report.test.ts` | NEW |
| layout files | MODIFY — register the test |

## Registry smoke diff (publish job, step `registry-smoke`)

Publishing behaviour is unchanged: the same six bounded version reads, the same single
`npm dist-tag ls`, the same continuation to the GitHub release when reads stay pending, the same
hard failure on an unexpected version. The existing executed test in
`tests/ci-workflows/ci-workflows.test.ts` pins every npm call shape; nothing here adds a call.

     needs: [validate-dispatch, verify-release]

```diff

+        run: bash scripts/ci/release-outcome-report.sh
```

`attach-release` already holds `contents: write` for the upload; the report only reads
(`gh release view`). Job permissions are unchanged. The step runs after "Attach to the release",
so the GitHub row reflects the draft flip, and `always()` keeps the row visible when the attach
step failed. The resume path (`published=true` without a new publish) reaches the same smoke and
report.

## scripts/ci/release-outcome-report.sh (full text)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Report what a release run established, one fact per row.
#
# npm publication, the registry read-back, the dist-tag and the public GitHub release are four
# separate facts, and a green run used to read the same whichever of them were true: the registry
# smoke warns "Registry lookup not confirmed" and the run still continues to the GitHub release.
# This writes each outcome as its own row of the job summary and adds a warning annotation for
# every row that is not confirmed. It never changes the run's result; publishing behaviour is
# owned by the publish and attach steps.
#
# Environment: RELEASE_VERSION, NPM_DIST_TAG, GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY (required);
# NPM_VERSION_STATE and NPM_DIST_TAG_STATE from the publish job (confirmed | mismatch |
# unconfirmed; empty when the smoke never ran).

## Tests (`tests/ci-workflows/release-outcome-report.test.ts`)

Structure (fail on the old shape): the smoke step writes `npm_version=` and `npm_dist_tag=`;
`publish.outputs` maps both from `steps.registry-smoke.outputs`; the last `attach-release` step
has `if: always()`, reads both job outputs through `env`, and runs the report script.

Execution, smoke (fake `npm`/`timeout` shell functions as in the existing executed test):

| npm dist-tag ls output | `npm_dist_tag` |
| --- | --- |
| `latest: 9.8.7` | confirmed |
| `latest: 9.8.6` | mismatch + warning |
| read fails | unconfirmed + warning |
| version reads stay pending | `npm_version=unconfirmed`, `npm_dist_tag=unconfirmed` |

Execution, report (fake `gh` on PATH):

| gh answer | NPM states | Summary rows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `false` | confirmed / confirmed | published / confirmed / confirmed; no warning |
| `true` | confirmed / mismatch | draft / confirmed / points at another version; two warnings |
| exit 1 | empty / empty | not found / not confirmed / not confirmed; exit 0 |
