/**
 * The quorum predicate must not read the auth store on every request.
 *
 * `hasAnthropicFailoverQuorum` decides whether an Anthropic request records the account that
 * served it, so it runs on the INITIAL resolution of ordinary traffic -- not only after a 429.
 * `getAccountSet` goes through `loadAuthStore`, which has no cache: it chmods the config dir,
 * chmods the secret, reads the whole file and normalizes it on every call. An uncached predicate
 * therefore puts a synchronous file read in front of every Anthropic turn.
 *
 * The generic module already solved this with a TTL-bounded count cache. These tests pin the same
 * three properties for the Anthropic twin: the read is shared inside the window, a fresh login is
 * still visible once it expires, and a rotation invalidates immediately rather than answering the
 * next question from a pre-failure count.
