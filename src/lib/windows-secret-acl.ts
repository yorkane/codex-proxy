/**
 * Windows per-user NTFS ACL hardening for secret files and directories.
 *
 * On Windows, `chmod` only controls POSIX-style bits in the ACE list and does NOT remove
 * inherited permissions from other users. Real per-user isolation requires icacls to:
 *   1. Grant the current user full control (icacls path /grant:r "CURRENTUSER:(F)")
 *   2. Disable inheritance               (icacls path /inheritance:r)
 *   3. Strip broad explicit grants by SID (Everyone, Users, Authenticated Users)
 *
 * Owner grant MUST precede `/inheritance:r`. That flag is destructive: it drops inherited
 * ACEs immediately. If a later step times out after inheritance is removed but before an
 * explicit owner ACE exists, the temp is left with a protected empty DACL — owned by the
 * current user yet unreadable/ununlinkable until Full Control is restored (issue #596).
 *
 * On non-Windows platforms the helpers fall through to the caller's existing chmod-based
 * behaviour: they return ok:true without invoking any external process.
 *
 * Design:
 *   hardenSecretPath(path, { required: false }) — non-fatal read-path mode.
 *     Never throws. Returns { ok, diagnostics? }.
 *   hardenSecretPath(path, { required: true })  — write-path mode.
 *     Throws a sanitized error (no raw path) on every Windows ACL failure,
 *     including genuine icacls timeouts. Required secret publication therefore
 *     fails closed; only required:false read-path probes may soft-fail.
 *   hardenSecretPathAsync / hardenSecretDirAsync — same policy, async icacls
 *     runner so the event loop is not held for the child lifetime (#612).
 *   HardenOptions.timeoutMemoKey — optional destination-path key for the
 *     timeout memo (atomic writers mint unique temps; never a parent directory).
 *   hardenSecretDir  — same contract for directories.

 *
 * `bigint: true` is used because `ctimeNs` exists only in that variant.
