# opencodex Structure Index

This folder is the maintainer source of truth for the current system shape. Public user workflows
belong in `docs-site/`. Development work is recorded in `devlog/` units — `_plan/` while open,
`_fin/` once closed.

Generated from `structure/manifest.json` by `bun run structure:index`. Do not edit by hand; `bun run structure:check` fails when this file and the manifest disagree. The rules for changing anything
in this folder are in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Reading order

### Tier 1 — Foundation

What opencodex is, what it owns on disk, and the invariants nothing may break.

| Doc | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| [`overview.md`](overview.md) | Product boundary, local state ownership, and the non-negotiable invariants index. |
| [`runtime.md`](runtime.md) | Entrypoints, process lifecycle, CLI surface, and the Remote Hub, sideband, and request-compatibility contracts on that path. |

### Tier 2 — Configuration and catalog

Persisted config, the Codex home it writes into, and the model catalog it publishes.

| Doc | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| [`config.md`](config.md) | Persisted config schema, both injection forms, provider validation, and restore. |
| [`codex-home.md`](codex-home.md) | CODEX_HOME resolution, the files opencodex manages there, and Codex-home diagnostics. |

## Which doc describes which source

A source area can be described by more than one doc, because these docs are organised by topic and
`src/` is organised by module. Changing an area requires review of every listed document. Edit only the documents whose local explanation changes; named cross-cutting authorities and dependents are listed below.

Source review remains defined by the source-to-doc map above. This registry names each authoritative statement and the documents that review it. Link validation proves declared topology, not behavioral correctness.

## Decision records

Superseded reasoning lives in `decisions/` as numbered records. A doc states the contract that holds now and
links the record that explains why; it never carries the reasoning inline.
