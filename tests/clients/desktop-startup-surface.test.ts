/**
 * The startup surface exists before the work it reports on.
 *
 * Discovery, the liveness probe, the sidecar spawn and the health wait all used to run inside
 * `setup()`, and the window was created hidden afterwards. Every failure in that stretch was
 * therefore invisible: the spawn event stream was destructured into `_events` and dropped, so the
 * child's exit code went with it, and a run of probes that time out rather than refuse takes over a
 * minute with nothing on screen. Ordering is the whole of the fix, and a state that reports work
 * already finished elsewhere is not a state — it is a label. Both are read out of the source.
