/**
 * The two quota parsers, pinned against each other.
 *
 * Codex reports the same account state twice: as response headers on every request, and as a
 * WHAM usage payload on refresh. `parseUsageQuota` classified windows by DURATION from the
 * start; `parseUpstreamQuotaHeaders` only knew "explicitly monthly, or else weekly". While
 * Codex had no 5-hour window that difference was invisible. When the window came back for Plus
 * and Team, the header path started filing a 5h reading as the weekly one, discarding the real
 * weekly value and leaving the account exhausted long after the burst reset.
 *
 * This is the assertion that would have caught it: the parsers must agree about WHICH WINDOW a
 * number belongs to, whichever wire it arrived on. It compares window assignment rather than
 * whole objects, because the WHAM payload also carries provenance and Spark windows the header
 * wire does not.
