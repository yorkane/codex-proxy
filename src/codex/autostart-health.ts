 * What to say at the end of setup, once routing is on disk and the autostart choice is made.
 *
 * #5261: applying the Codex integration does not install a background service, and on Windows
 * the scheduled task that a separate install would create is logon-triggered rather than
 * boot-triggered. So "routing written, nothing listening" is an ordinary state after a restart
 * rather than a corruption — and the user is never told, because setup ends on a success line.
 *
 * A boot trigger is not the missing piece and would be a false reassurance. The task runs as
 * the interactive user, so before logon there is no session for it to run in; making it truly
 * pre-logon means a different principal and a different service backend, not another trigger.
 * What is actually missing is that nobody says the dependency exists, which is cheap to fix and
 * true on every platform.
 *
 * Reuses the existing health model rather than re-deriving the condition, so this cannot drift
 * from what `ocx status` and `ocx doctor` report about the same install.
