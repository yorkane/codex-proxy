// Registry model renames do not reach a saved provider config on their own.
//
// `reconcileOAuthProviders` refuses to touch a row whose `authMode` is not
// `oauth` (src/oauth/index.ts), and `enrichProviderFromRegistry` is fill-only by
// design: it backfills a MISSING field and never rewrites a present one, so a
// user's hand-edited model list survives an upgrade. Both postures are correct.
// Their gap is the case where the registry did not ADD a model but RENAMED one:
// the saved row keeps a retired id forever, the supported id never appears, and
// the capability metadata stays keyed to an id the vendor is taking offline
// (issue #1610 — `qwen3.8-max-preview` persisted through the `qwen3.8-max`
// rename in six separate fields, including a reasoning ladder that had since
// diverged from the registry's).
//
// This migration is deliberately NOT general reconciliation. It rewrites exactly
// one thing: an id this file declares retired, on a provider that still carries
// the registry's transport, and only when the registry currently seeds the
// replacement — and it skips a field where the retired entry is registry residue
// with nothing left to carry forward (see `isRegistryResidue`, issue #5066).
// Everything else in the row is left alone.

/**
 * Whether this field’s retired entry is registry residue rather than something to repair.

 * Two things have to be true. The registry’s own seed — `providerConfigSeed`, the row both the
 * OAuth preset (`deriveOAuthProviderConfig`) and `enrichProviderFromRegistry` contribute — must
 * still publish the retired id in this field, so the entry arrives in the config on its own. And
 * the saved field must already carry the supported id, so the rename would only DELETE a key,
 * with nothing to carry forward.
 *
 * Under those two conditions the rewrite is worse than a no-op, because it never converges.
 * `startServer` runs this migration and then `reconcileOAuthProviders`, and
 * `applyOAuthPresetCatalog` copies the preset’s record over the saved one whenever the two
 * differ. The deletion is undone inside the same boot, the config is written twice, and the user
 * is told about a rename that never sticks on every single start. Issue #5066 is exactly that:
 * `ANTIGRAVITY_MODEL_CONTEXT_WINDOWS` derives a window for every compatibility alias, so
 * `modelContextWindows` holds a key for all nine retired Flash ids beside the live ones — the
 * nine `[model-rename-migration]` lines the reporter saw at every `ocx start`, none of which
 * required them to have selected any of those nine models.
 *
 * Those registry entries are deliberate and stay: a request that still names `gemini-3.6-flash`
 * routes to 3.7 and needs a context window under the id it asked for. The second condition is
 * what keeps this narrow. A row that saved `{ "gemini-3.6-flash": 1048576 }` and nothing else
 * still gets the value carried onto the supported id, because dropping it there would blank the
 * record instead of moving it (`tests/adapters/google/gemini-37-flash-migration.test.ts`).
