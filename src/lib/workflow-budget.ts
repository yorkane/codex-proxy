/**
 * Root-workflow admission: a finite budget above the logical request (#4546).
 *
 * The per-request send budget bounds how many times ONE request reaches upstream. It cannot
 * bound how many requests a fan-out makes. A worker that spawns seven hundred children, each
 * of which sends exactly once, never violates a per-request cap and still spends the account.
 * That is the second half of the #4546 incident and it needs a ceiling of its own.
 *
 * The unit is the root workflow -- the user-visible task -- identified by the parent thread
 * header when the client supplies one. A retry is not a new user task and gets no new
 * allowance; a genuinely new top-level request does.
 *
 * Two caps intersect here. The COUNT caps (concurrency, distinct children, physical sends)
 * are process-local and in-memory. The TOKEN cap is the durable spend-reservation ledger in
 * spend-reservation-ledger.ts: when the caller supplies a spend request, admission also
 * reserves input + enforceable output ceiling against the root, identity and pool scopes,
 * and that accounting survives a restart. The count caps alone remain the guarantee for a
 * second process sharing the pool; the durable ledger's single-process topology is stated
 * in that module's header and applies here unchanged.
