/**
 * Regression coverage for #1797 (llama.cpp dual-envelope metadata).
 *
 * A llama.cpp server splits one model across two arrays: an Ollama-style
 * `models[]` carrying `capabilities` and an OpenAI-style `data[]` carrying
 * `meta`. Discovery reads only `data[]`, so the served context (`meta.n_ctx`)
 * and the image signal (`multimodal`) never met and a correct server produced
 * a context-unknown, image-blind row.
 *
 * Both halves now resolve. The tests below also pin the boundary that makes
 * the join safe: admission is decided on the original `data[]` row before any
 * enrichment, and only capability keys are copied.
