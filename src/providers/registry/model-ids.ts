/**
 * What a registry field's KEYS mean for selector decoding.
 *
 * An encoded selector is decoded against the native model ids a provider is known to accept.
 * That set used to be a hand-written list of eight registry maps, so an id declared only in an
 * unlisted map could not be decoded, and every new model-keyed field had to be remembered.
 *
 * Every field of ProviderRegistryEntry is classified below, including the ones that carry no
 * model identity at all. That is deliberate: the "satisfies" check makes a new registry field a
 * TYPE error until somebody decides what its keys mean, rather than letting it default to
 * invisible. The two checks are different and both matter - the satisfies clause proves the
 * classification is exhaustive when this compiles, and the parity test proves the fields the
 * shipped registry actually carries are the ones classified here.
 *
 * These are decode hints and nothing more. A hint does not publish a catalog row, grant
 * availability or entitlement, and it does not confer transport authority: the caller still
 * checks registry transport identity before asking for them, and an ambiguous selector is still
 * rejected rather than guessed.
