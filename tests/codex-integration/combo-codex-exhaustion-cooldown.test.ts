/**
 * The ChatGPT Codex backend reports a depleted plan window as HTTP 502 `upstream_server_error`
 * carrying the prose `The usage limit has been reached`, never the documented 429. The
 * quota-cap predicate is gated on 429, so a dead account took the generic 60-second cooldown and
 * was re-offered every minute: 942 doomed sends in 72h of production ledger, each surfacing as
 * `adapter_eof`, plus 94 downstream `503 No available targets`. See #5860.
 *
 * The fix is duration only. Delete the exhaustion arm of `coolComboTarget`'s `cooldownMs` chain
 * and the ten-minute assertions below go back to 60 seconds.
