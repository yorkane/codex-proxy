 * the TOML inf/nan guard below.
 *
 * Numbers: `1e999` overflows to Infinity (a rewrite bakes in `null` — the merge
 * layer's JSON clone does it even before the serializer could refuse), `1e-9999`
 * underflows to `+0`, an integer literal may have been rounded (a rewrite then
 * hands consumers that read JSON integers exactly — python, jq, BigInt revivers
 * — a different value), and `-0` re-serializes as `0`. Only literals whose value
 * actually changed are refused: `1e21`, `1e-320` or 2^54 round-trip exactly and
 * stay usable.
 *
 * Duplicate members: `{"a":1,"a":2}` parses to a single `a`, so rewriting the
 * document DELETES the earlier member. That is content loss, not the formatting
 * normalization we promise, and this classifier is what makes the rewrite of a
 * user-edited file reachable at all — so it fails closed here.
 *
 * Depth: the same pass counts container nesting against MAX_JSON_NESTING
 * (shared with the serializer, see serialize.ts). JSON.parse handles hundreds
 * of thousands of levels iteratively, but the downstream merge and
 * JSON.stringify recurse — a 100KB file nested 50k deep sailed through parse
 * and guard, then blew up serialization with a raw RangeError after a
 * multi-GB allocation spike. A hand-written scan rather than a JSON.parse
 * source-access reviver on purpose: the reviver walk recurses internally, so
 * its depth limit would be an unpredictable stack size instead of this
 * deterministic ceiling.
