# Overview

Management provider-validation calls use the [shared relative send-path validation](config.md#provider-relative-send-paths) before persistence.
Native steering follows [the shared WebSocket contract](transports/streaming-health.md#experimental-native-mid-turn-steering); this surface's defaults remain unchanged.

The dashboard's compile-checked locale catalogs include Vietnamese. Locale registration, browser
detection, Compatibility Lab labels, status descriptions, and locale-sensitive quota formatting
advance together under the `gui/` catalog parity contract.

The configuration-only [plaintext V2 contract](subagents.md#plaintext-v2-agent-messages)
is scoped to canonical ChatGPT Responses forwarding; other source-area behavior described here is unchanged.

Shared parsing and streaming follow the [request-copy](transports/byte-accounting.md#request-copy-accounting) and [stream-buffer accounting](transports/byte-accounting.md#stream-buffer-accounting) contracts.

## Product boundary

opencodex is a local proxy for Codex. It does not patch Codex binaries. It changes local Codex
state by writing root routing keys and a model catalog — a provider table only in the
API-auth-header form described in [`config.md`](config.md) —
then serves the Responses data plane:

```text
Codex CLI / TUI / App / SDK
  -> http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1/responses
  -> opencodex routing + adapter bridge
  -> upstream provider
```

Responses is the primary surface. The same listener also answers Anthropic-shaped `/v1/messages`
and OpenAI-shaped `/v1/chat/completions`. On the routed path those are inbound translations onto the
same routing and adapter bridge rather than separate products; `/v1/messages` additionally has a
native Anthropic passthrough branch that forwards without translation. The Live/Realtime surface is
different in kind — it resolves an OpenAI/ChatGPT relay and forwards to it directly, without the
adapter bridge.

The default install keeps native OpenAI/ChatGPT passthrough working through one option-aware
`openai` provider. Pool is the default and selects across main plus added accounts; Direct uses only
the current caller/main login. `openai-apikey` explicitly selects API-key transport, and the two
credential routes never fall through into one another. Built-in provider presets include Anthropic,
Google, Azure, Neuralwatt Cloud, Tencent Cloud Coding Plan, SiliconFlow, and separate Volcengine Ark
pay-as-you-go, Coding Plan, and Agent Plan endpoints. Crusoe Serverless Inference is a fixed-host
API-key preset with registry-owned authenticated model discovery. Additional
providers are routed by explicit `provider/model`, provider model lists, or the configured
`defaultProvider`.

Native model retirement changes the advertised catalog and model-specific quota support; it
preserves saved user model selections and historical usage. See the bounded
[catalog policy](catalog.md#shared-catalog) and [legacy settings contract](config.md#config-surface).

## Local state

`~/.opencodex/` is the default state root and `OPENCODEX_HOME` overrides it; the GUI and the
installed service resolve it the same way (`src/config.ts`). Ownership inside that root is tracked
by the uninstall manifest in `src/lib/config-ownership.ts`, which starts from a declared path list
and grows as opencodex claims further paths at runtime — so the manifest, not this table, is what
bounds uninstall. Newly generated recovery backups follow the [backup ownership contract](config.md#restore)
without suppressing recovery when registration is unavailable. This table groups state by purpose; it is not an exhaustive file list, and
derived files such as `auth.json.pre-multiauth` are covered by the group they belong to.

`$CODEX_HOME` is a separate root with a separate owner, and opencodex writes there too: removing the
opencodex state root does not undo those writes. Putting native Codex back is the job of
`ocx restore`/`eject` and the injection journal, not of deleting a directory.

| Path | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `~/.opencodex/config.json` | opencodex | Init creates via private temp plus no-replace hard link; dashboard and explicit updates use atomic replacement. |
| `~/.opencodex/auth.json` | opencodex | OAuth tokens; not committed. Multiauth shape: `provider -> { activeAccountId, accounts[] }` (legacy single-credential values normalize on load; a one-time `auth.json.pre-multiauth` backup guards downgrades). ChatGPT scratch OAuth stays separate from the Codex account store. For multi-slot providers, credentials without `accountId`/email replace the active slot on a normal login; an explicit add-account login preserves the prior slot and appends a distinct one. Single-slot providers such as ChatGPT remain replacement-only. |
| `~/.opencodex/codex-accounts.json` | opencodex | Hardened main-plus-added credential store used by `openai` in Pool mode. |
| `~/.opencodex/catalog-backup.json` | opencodex | One-time pristine Codex catalog backup for restore; per-catalog copies are hashed variants (see [`catalog.md`](catalog.md)). |
| `~/.opencodex/usage.jsonl` | opencodex | Append-only request usage log (0o600); request metadata + token counts only, never prompts or auth. |
| `~/.opencodex/ocx.pid`, `runtime-port.json`, `system-env-port` | opencodex runtime | Live process identity and the port a client should reach; rewritten on start. `runtime-port.json` also carries the protected per-process listener-attestation key used before CLI diagnostics attach a management bearer. |
| `~/.opencodex/codex-runtime.json`, `codex-runtime-clamp.json` | opencodex Codex runtime | Selected Codex executable/version state and effort-clamp diagnostics. Not process identity: these persist a resolved choice and a diagnostic, so losing them changes behavior until re-resolved. |
| `~/.opencodex/service-state.json`, `service.log`, `service-api-token`, `opencodex-service-launcher.vbs`, `opencodex-service-task.xml`, `opencodex-service.cmd`, `winsw`, `tray-state.json`, `tray-heartbeat.json`, `opencodex-tray.ps1`, `opencodex-tray-*.ico`, `update-job.json` | opencodex operators | Installed-service, Windows tray, and self-update artifacts and bookkeeping. The update record carries its worker PID so a dead worker recovers instead of blocking later runs. |
| `~/.opencodex/responses-state.json`, `responses-state-spill/`, `usage-debug.jsonl`, `crash.log`, `artifacts/` | opencodex diagnostics and artifacts | Bounded caches, diagnostics, and generated image/video artifacts served locally. The spill directory holds continuation state demoted out of the in-memory cap and is bounded in aggregate, not only per file. |
| `~/.opencodex/codex-shim.json`, `*.lock`, `kimi-device-id`, `mimo-client-id`, `.star-prompted` | opencodex bookkeeping | Shim restore obligations, cross-process locks, per-install client identifiers, one-shot UI flags. |
| `~/.opencodex/.opencodex-owner.json`, `.opencodex-uninstall.json` | opencodex | Ownership marker and the manifest that bounds what uninstall may remove. Both live in the OpenCodex state root, not in `$CODEX_HOME`. |
| `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` | Codex, edited by opencodex | Active provider and provider table. |
| `$CODEX_HOME/opencodex.config.toml` | opencodex | Optional profile for explicit Codex opt-in. |
| `$CODEX_HOME/opencodex-catalog.json` | opencodex | Shared native+routed model catalog. |
| `$CODEX_HOME/opencodex-journal.json` | opencodex | Injection journal used by restore to strip only marker-owned values while preserving later user edits. |
| `$CODEX_HOME/models_cache.json` | Codex, invalidated by opencodex | Cache invalidated after model/catalog changes. |
| `dist/`, `gui/dist/`, `node_modules/` | generated | Build output/dependencies. |

OrcaRouter login returns credentials for storage only after bounded response ingestion and payload
validation. The shared reader's cancellation contract and the login-specific byte/deadline limits
are defined in [bounded response ingestion](transports/inventory.md#bounded-response-ingestion-and-orcarouter-login).

## Non-negotiable invariants

Each invariant carries a stable id. A bound invariant names one test, and that test names the id
back, so deleting or renaming the test fails `bun run structure:check` instead of quietly unbinding the
rule. The binding proves the test EXISTS and is claimed; it does not prove the assertions inside it
still cover the rule, which is a judgement only review makes.

- **INV-WS-01** — `websockets` defaults to `false`; only `true` advertises `supports_websockets`.
  Enforced by `tests/codex-integration/codex-catalog.test.ts`.
- **INV-TOML-01** — Root TOML keys such as `model_provider` and `model_catalog_json` must stay
  before any table.
  Enforced by `tests/codex-integration/codex-inject.test.ts`.
- **INV-OPENAI-01** — OpenAI has one `openai` Codex-login provider with Pool(default)/Direct modes
  and a separate `openai-apikey`; see [`openai-tiers.md`](providers/openai-tiers.md).
  Enforced by `tests/adapters/openai/openai-provider-option.test.ts`.
- **INV-AGENT-01** — Codex `spawn_agent` visibility depends on the first five featured catalog
  entries.
  Enforced by `tests/codex-integration/catalog-full-picker-order.test.ts`.
- **INV-AUTH-01** — The management plane (`/api/*`) and the data plane (`/v1/*`) never share an
  admission credential.
  Enforced by `tests/server/server-management-auth.test.ts`.
- **INV-RESTORE-01** — `ocx restore` restores native Codex from the pristine catalog with
  retired bare/account-qualified native rows omitted from the output; the original backup stays
  unchanged. The service-stop and uninstall paths of the same promise are covered
  separately in `tests/cli/restore-completes-shared-teardown.test.ts` and are not bound to this id.
  Enforced by `tests/codex-integration/codex-catalog-restore.test.ts`.
- **INV-TESTS-01** — `tests/` is organised by domain (`tests/<domain>/`, mirroring `src/`); the map
  is `scripts/test-layout/layout.json` and `tests/test-layout.test.ts` rejects a test outside its
  domain. Only the two layout guards sit at the root. Source-oracle tests reach the repository
  through `tests/helpers/repo-root.ts`, never `import.meta.dir + "/.."`. Provider additions register
  their focused test in both the explicit layout map and its expected-map fixture.
  Enforced by `tests/test-layout.test.ts`.
- **INV-START-01** — `ocx start` never answers a busy preferred port by starting on another one. It
  identifies the holder first and stops either way: refused as a duplicate when an opencodex answers
  there, reported as an unidentified holder otherwise. A configured `port: 0` still asks the OS for a
  port, and an explicit `--port` still waits for its pin instead of hopping.
  Enforced by `tests/cli/cli-dispatch.test.ts`.

CI enumerates that domain layout through `scripts/ci/run-bun-test-batches.sh`. Its default general
scope and 12-file/120-second process shape leave the dedicated Linux storage-policy and api-usage
jobs out of the general shards. The manual Windows matrix selects all-file scope and overrides the
process shape to six files and 480 seconds, so batching changes process size without changing the
platform suite's file set. Its dedicated batch step sets `OCX_TEST_NO_QUEUE=1`: those sequential
processes are one logical runner, while each process still installs its own isolated home and test
guards. The workflow contract and process bounds live in
[`ops/docs-and-release.md`](ops/docs-and-release.md#cross-platform-ci).

Two invariants are stated here without a binding, and `grace.unboundInvariants` in
[`manifest.json`](manifest.json) carries the reason for each. They are true statements about the system;
no test in this repository currently pins them, and saying so is more useful than naming a test that
would pass while the rule was violated.

- **INV-HOME-01** — `CODEX_HOME` wins over `~/.codex` when present and valid.
- **INV-SLUG-01** — Routed model slugs use `provider/model`.

Codex plan exclusions constrain automatic pool selection without deleting credentials; [account-policy reasons](providers/openai-tiers.md#automatic-pool-plan-exclusions) remain distinct from health and pause.

Connected CLI usage follows the [client-scoped hub usage contract](gui-and-management-api.md#usage-accounting); local management and account data remain separate.

The shared atomic replacement publisher also identifies explicit Remote Workspace file writes as `remote-workspace`; its isolated owner and support limits are documented in [Remote Workspace](remote-workspace.md).

Remote Workspace uses a separate, explicitly enabled server surface with structural WebSocket callbacks and awaited per-server cleanup; [its contract](remote-workspace.md) owns that integration.

Usage consumers preserve positive incomplete-history metadata as specified in [usage accounting](gui-and-management-api.md#usage-accounting); readable totals are not represented as a complete ledger.

Listener startup diagnostics follow [the runtime lifecycle contract](runtime.md#lifecycle); malformed optional listener blocks follow [config loading](config.md#config-surface).
The management quota DTO keeps Combo editing aligned with scoped inference evidence;
see [Combo editor routing quota](gui-and-management-api.md#combo-editor-routing-quota).

Codex pool settings and their consumers follow the [reset-first ordering contract](providers/openai-tiers.md#reset-first-account-ordering), including independent-quota fallback, preserved affinity, strategy-specific threshold summaries, and shared short-observation freshness for switch warnings.

Optional Codex transport-hint suppression is scoped to canonical Responses client output;
its defaults and exclusions are owned by [Responses transport](transports/responses.md).

Raw reasoning content and provider-authored summaries remain distinct on the Responses wire. See [reasoning presentation](providers/chat-compat.md).

Connected-browser pairing and dashboard failure meanings follow the [management UI contract](gui-and-management-api.md#dashboard-surfaces); machine enrollment alone does not authenticate a browser.

Native-main reauthentication keeps its existing polling cadence when a non-2xx status races with retryable cancellation for the same owned flow; the [dashboard flow-ownership contract](gui-and-management-api.md#dashboard-surfaces) defines terminal release and completion notification.

Cline CLI is a managed file integration: its provider settings and catalog share one recoverable journal operation. The [paired-file contract](clients/integrations.md#cline-paired-files) defines its stop/restart requirement.
Pool quota producers and account commands follow the [bounded raw-observation contract](providers/openai-tiers.md#bounded-pool-quota-observations), separate from the latest display snapshot and capacity estimates.

Account quota surfaces use [safe probe diagnostics](transports/inventory.md#account-quota-failure-diagnostics) separately from quota validity, credential health and routing authority.

Translated Chat request construction uses the [inline-image budget](transports/streaming-health.md#translated-chat-inline-image-budget); the shared normalizer counts retained bytes even when a wire-specific drop callback keeps the image attached.

The [explicit model-capability contract](config.md#explicit-per-model-capability-declarations) preserves operator declarations through provider storage and catalog capture; it does not infer upstream capability or change this surface's routing behavior.

Provider-scoped approval reviewer settings are projected by the [catalog owner](catalog.md#provider-scoped-approval-reviewer); this surface retains its existing routing, transport and account-selection behavior.

Shared response-log retention and native SSE inspection pacing follow the [bounded inspection contract](transports/byte-accounting.md#response-log-inspection); other subsystem behavior remains unchanged.

Native steering generation overrides, explicit public-API eligibility and the consent-gated wire probe follow the [shared control contract](transports/streaming-health.md#steering-settings-public-api-and-diagnostic-probe); this owner does not change routing or execute diagnostic tools.

Dashboard Fast-row persistence and client refresh follow the [Fast selector rows setting contract](gui-and-management-api.md#fast-selector-rows-setting).
