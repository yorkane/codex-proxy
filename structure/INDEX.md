# opencodex Structure Index

This folder is the maintainer source of truth for the current system shape. Public user workflows
belong in `docs-site/`. Development work is recorded in `devlog/` units — `_plan/` while open,
`_fin/` once closed — while `docs/` keeps investigations and diagnostic notes worth retaining for
archaeology, debugging, or source research.

Generated from `structure/manifest.json` by `bun run structure:index`. Do not edit by hand; `bun run structure:check` fails when this file and the manifest disagree. The rules for changing anything
in this folder are in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Reading order

### Tier 1 — Foundation

What opencodex is, what it owns on disk, and the invariants nothing may break.

| Doc | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| [`overview.md`](overview.md) | Product boundary, local state ownership, and the non-negotiable invariants index. |
| [`runtime.md`](runtime.md) | Entrypoints, process lifecycle, CLI surface, and the Remote Hub, sideband, and request-compatibility contracts on that path. |

### Tier 2 — Configuration and catalog

Persisted config, the Codex home it writes into, and the model catalog it publishes.

| Doc | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| [`config.md`](config.md) | Persisted config schema, both injection forms, provider validation, and restore. |
| [`codex-home.md`](codex-home.md) | CODEX_HOME resolution, the files opencodex manages there, and Codex-home diagnostics. |
| [`catalog.md`](catalog.md) | Shared Codex catalog assembly, account namespaces, pool rotation, and effort ladders. |
| [`subagents.md`](subagents.md) | Multi-agent surface mode and subagent roster ordering. |

## Which doc describes which source

A source area can be described by more than one doc, because these docs are organised by topic and
`src/` is organised by module. Changing an area requires review of every listed document. Edit only the documents whose local explanation changes; named cross-cutting authorities and dependents are listed below.

### Not described by any doc

| Source path | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `src/bridge.ts` | no doc names this file; it is the legacy adapter bridge entry and its behavior is described under the adapter registry without a path reference |
| `src/bridge/` | no doc names this directory; it holds the leaves moved out of the src/bridge.ts facade and inherits the same adapter-registry description the facade has |
| `src/quota/` | no doc names a path here; quota evidence is described in providers/openai-tiers.md in prose only |
| `src/service-manager-probe.ts` | no doc names this file; service probing is described in ops/service-and-sidecars.md without a path reference |
| `src/sidecar/` | no doc names a path here; ops/service-and-sidecars.md describes sidecar behavior in prose only |
| `src/types/` | shared declarations plus the tool-name and wire-pin resolvers, which no doc currently describes |

## Cross-cutting contracts

Source review remains defined by the source-to-doc map above. This registry names each authoritative statement and the documents that review it. Link validation proves declared topology, not behavioral correctness.

## Decision records

Superseded reasoning lives in `decisions/` as numbered records. A doc states the contract that holds now and
links the record that explains why; it never carries the reasoning inline.
