## Transformation contract

NEW files carry the complete immutable source body. For moved tests, rewrite source imports `../src/` to `../../src/`, helper imports `./helpers/` to `../helpers/`, and obsolete fake-server paths to their current fixture owner. Register every new test in both layout.json explicit and test-layout-expected.json. Source-file reads and subprocess fixture paths use tests/helpers/repo-root.ts. Shared existing files take only source PR hunks, preserving all newer dev behavior; resolve conflicts against the named owner before writing. All original adopted implementation receives the coauthor trailer.

Expand the public module exports to the immutable source index (plus any omitted workspace-runtime export only when a consumer requires it). Keep workspace-runtime lazily constructed and unattached to the core. Export win atomic-replace helper only if current owner remains unexported. Preserve newer package metadata and add only native source packaging entries/helper script names. Native source and lockfile are carried; no workflow modification is authorized.

Reachable negatives: unapproved root and traversal; symlink/hardlink alias; changed helper digest; absent confinement provider; cancelled pending RPC; offline executor with no local fallback; revoked token; expired/used pairing code; rate-limit threshold. Runtime session/fake-provider tests exercise interruption/reconnect and cleanup. Existing final hosted suite is the executable verifier. Native OS confinement not run by existing workflows stays an explicit unmet acceptance item.

## Data and enforcement chain

Required acceptance (not an established property of the pinned source): identity/capability creation comes from protocol builders and device root approval; serializers carry bounded versioned messages; strict parsers recover them; handshake/coordinator/executor consumers enforce capabilities and roots. GUI only displays public state. Tier: runtime boundary; executing surface: parser/auth/executor code. Known bypass: a process with the operator account can invoke host tools directly. Residual: local operator compromise is outside this process boundary. Wording: bounded remote tools, no claim of host-user isolation. Final layer for commands: OS confinement probe; unavailable means exec is not advertised.

## Verification and rollback

Local tests/build/typecheck/install NOT RUN by user instruction. Text comparison and git diff --check observe this change but are not product tests. Existing hosted CI command definitions are inspected before dispatch; final SHA evidence is recorded in phase 4. Revert this layer before its parent; no persistent state migrations are performed by this carry task.

## Session contract adaptation

The executor endpoint receives explicit immutable sessionId, rootId and granted capabilities from the session owner. The agent connection constructs these options from the selected session and accepted capability set. The RPC boundary compares each request with that binding before invoking file or command tools. Test constructors provide the same explicit bindings; negative fixtures cover each mismatch and capability reduction. Keep detailed review evidence in ignored scratch.

## Design reflection amendments

REMOTE-ARCH-001/002: Add required per-session capabilities to HubAgentConnection.openSession; initial SessionService.create and ensureRemoteTransport pass their session capability subset. The signed hello carries that subset; accepted.hello.capabilities is copied into endpoint state. Selected root is conveyed by authenticated WSS under the explicitly trusted paired Hub; endpoint snapshots rootId and sessionId and validates locally approved root before session acceptance. Encrypted requests must match session/device/root and tool capability. Zero-executor-invocation negatives vary each independently, including an otherwise-approved second root. No opaque untrusted relay is introduced for workspace control frames.

REMOTE-ARCH-003: Separate persisted enrollment capabilities from current connection availability. Presence may reduce effective connection authority but cannot expand the enrollment grant. Preserve the enrollment set in persisted device state, compute public effective capabilities as its intersection with current connection capabilities, and intersect new presence before acknowledgement. Device advertisement and acknowledgement accept reduced capabilities. Test downgrade, reconnect restoration inside grant, and attempted expansion beyond grant.

REMOTE-ARCH-006: Use existing required private-file/Windows ACL primitives for new identity and bearer stores. Check permission setup failures and refuse loading/saving secrets when enforcement fails. Do not change global config-store behavior. Record exact selected existing helper in phase-2 P after reading the owner; no best-effort function is accepted as proof.

REMOTE-ARCH-007: Codex real App Server tests depend on OCX_CODEX_BIN; Claude real integration on OCX_CLAUDE_BIN; Pi on OCX_PI_BIN. The Linux confinement case can return without execution unless OCX_REQUIRE_LINUX_REMOTE_WORKSPACE_CONFINEMENT=1 or bwrap is available. Current generic CI alone does not prove those paths. Mock tests prove lifecycle and tool-routing contracts only; native Hub isolation and executor confinement stay explicit final acceptance gaps when not activated. For each adapter separately record denied local tools, inherited plugins/hooks/config, offline refusal and teardown; inspect source plus hosted mocks, no claims of live CLI confinement from flags alone.

## Phase-2 revalidation and exact owner choices

Previous D: wp1 inactive foundation source cycle complete at 726ddc7fc0; final hosted proof remains wp4. Continue in child branch codex/260912-60plus-remote-runtime. Existing public exports and added host-negative coverage are retained.

REMOTE-ARCH-004: storage modules import atomicWriteFile directly from src/config/atomic-write.ts and getConfigDir from src/config/paths.ts, avoiding the broad config.ts barrel. Device CLI orchestration retains explicit runner construction because it computes actual availability after root approval; no import-time probe exists. This is intentional sequential coupling. Server seams in phase 3 use narrow structural connection/session interfaces rather than pulling concrete remote classes into shared request types. No remote module imports server surfaces.

REMOTE-ARCH-006 exact helpers: NEW src/remote-control/workspace-secret-store.ts owns prepareWorkspaceSecretDirectory(directory) and hardenWorkspaceSecretFile(path). On POSIX use chmodSync with propagated failure and lstat directory/file identity/type checks. On Windows call existing src/lib/windows-secret-acl.ts hardenSecretDir/hardenSecretPath with required:true. Reject symlink state targets. All three stores use this before reads and before atomicWriteFile. Existing atomic-write.ts already creates an empty private descriptor, hardens before writing bytes, and scrubs failures; retain it. Tests: NEW tests/clients/remote-workspace-secret-store.test.ts covers owner-only POSIX file mode, unexpected path types/symlinks and failed reads; hosted Windows ACL owner tests remain applicable. No global config behavior changes.

src/lib/windows-atomic-replace.ts change is the new ReplacePublisher literal remote-workspace (the function is already exported). Use existing counter serialization/consumers unchanged: creation at executor write, diagnostic key serialization, dynamic record readers; no closed switch to extend.

NEW tests/clients/remote-workspace-session-binding.test.ts covers session/device/root/capability mismatches with zero execution and a valid positive control, using encrypted messages and independent fixtures. MODIFY agent-wire, hub, sessions and device tests to assert subset negotiation and presence intersection. Platform runner source retains existing fail-closed native paths; remove stale comment claiming supported macOS commands.

### Audit amendment: store-level failure propagation

Hub/Device/Session file-store constructors accept an optional narrow permissions dependency containing prepareDirectory and hardenFile, defaulting to the required production helper. Load returns null for absent files; existing files require directory and file checks before secret reads. Save prepares directory, hardens an existing target, then invokes the existing private atomic writer. For each store, injected directory/file hardening throws must propagate, preserve existing bytes and prevent secret IO. New-state first-run controls return null then save/load valid fixtures. Add all three store cases to remote-workspace-secret-store.test.ts; this injection observes caller ordering rather than relying on ACL-owner tests alone.

### Native containment amendment

Independent source review requires a protected Linux bubblewrap executable outside writable roots, with identity revalidation before use. Custom executable files and their parent chain must not be writable by group/other; canonical system symlinks are resolved before checking. Workspace roots cannot contain the executable; every invocation rechecks. Add source/runner regression fixtures without claiming a local run.

Windows command availability remains disabled in this carry: nativeRemoteWorkspaceCommandRunnerAvailable returns false before invoking the helper, and the official Windows helper rejects public probe/run without allocating OS resources. The candidate Windows implementation remains in original PR history; do not retain callable unverified entrypoints. This matches the fail-closed macOS policy and preserves independently authorized file tools. Update native denial tests and docs; Windows working-command acceptance stays OPEN. A future lifecycle owner and hosted cancellation/cleanup evidence are required before re-enablement. This is a safety limitation, not completion of Windows commands.
