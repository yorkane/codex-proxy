 *
 * This is an opencodex ladder, not a claim that each model takes `output_config.effort`.
 * The adapter serves two wire shapes (src/adapters/anthropic.ts): adaptive families
 * (fable, sonnet >= 5, opus >= 4.7) send the effort directly, while opus 4.6, sonnet 4.6

 * and no effort parameter at all for haiku 4.5; the budget translation is what makes five
 * rungs meaningful there, and it clamps below `max_tokens` so none of them 400.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded, each because advertising it would offer a control that does not
 * do what it says:
 * - `minimal`: `adaptiveEffort` rewrites it to `low` (the adaptive wire 400s on it), so
 *   it is not a distinct setting.
 * - `none`: only sonnet >= 5 accepts an explicit thinking disable
 *   (`EXPLICIT_THINKING_DISABLE_FAMILY_MINIMUMS`); Fable rejects one outright.

 * Two standing notes (#1057):
 *
 * - `xhigh` is a COMPATIBILITY ALIAS, not a native tier. It stays in the wire maps
 *   so existing requests and saved configs keep working, but it is not advertised.
 * - `medium` has no row in the vendor table — mapping it to `high` is OUR
 *   compatibility choice for clients that only speak the OpenAI ladder.

// it now appears on /models for global Team, global Personal, and CN Team, and

// rejects enable_thinking:false with 400), 1M context, 131,072 max output,
// text-only input, strict json_schema accepted. glm-5.3-flash REMAINS OUT:
// still never served by the Token Plan gateway (docs.z.ai VLM id, not plan
// entitlement).
// The Beijing preset keeps the Personal Edition subset; non-chat ids (audio/image/
// video families) stay out: they answer only on async endpoints openai-chat cannot
// reach. deepseek-v4-pro-0813 is callable but NOT listed by /models, which is the
// reason liveModels must stay false for this provider. deepseek-v4.1-flash is the

// Beijing serves the Personal Edition, so this is the Personal-tier roster probed
// 260909 (a strict subset of Team). deepseek-v4-pro-0813 stays out of the Beijing
// entry: its callability is only proven on Team keys, and no Personal key has been
// shown to reach it. The Beijing entry also shares the intl maps, so it carries a
// few orphan keys (kimi/glm-5/MiniMax rows); harmless, and one map beats two

/**
 * 260804 issue #956: NIM publishes no input-modality metadata on `/v1/models`, so the
 * registry is the only source of truth for which models can see images.
 *
 * Two lists, both verified per-model against NVIDIA documentation on 2026-08-04
 * (build.nvidia.com model pages and docs.api.nvidia.com/nim/reference/*). Evidence and
 * the per-id audit: devlog/_fin/260804_stack7_service_vision/011_nim_id_audit.md.
 *
 * Read `noVisionModels` carefully — it lists models that CANNOT see images, which is
 * what routes them through the proxy's vision sidecar (src/vision/index.ts) and makes the
 * catalog advertise image input for them. Membership is wrong in BOTH directions:
 *   - a text-only model missing from it keeps issue #956 (images blocked or rejected);
 *   - a vision model wrongly IN it gets its image silently replaced by another model's
 *     text description — no error, worse answers, extra cost.
 *
 * A new NIM id must be classified DELIBERATELY against its NVIDIA page, never assumed
 * from its name: `google/gemma-4-31b-it` carries no vision marker yet accepts images,
 * `-vl` also appears on embedding/reranking models, and `google/codegemma-7b` is
 * text-only while `google/codegemma-1.1-7b` has no current page at all. An unclassified
 * id is intentionally left alone rather than defaulted, because NIM serves non-chat
 * endpoints (embeddings, rerankers, guards, OCR) that reach the same code path.
