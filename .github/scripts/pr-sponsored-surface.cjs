/**
 * Sponsorship for surfaces where a bad merge is expensive and hard to unwind.
 *
 * Derived from @Wibias's trust-lane gate (#902), narrowed on purpose. That
 * version also capped first-time contributors at one open pull request and 500
 * changed lines. Those caps are not here: a provider preset with its registry
 * rows, adapter wiring, tests, and five locales clears 500 lines by itself, and
 * several good first contributions to this repository have. Telling a newcomer
 * their fix is too big is a worse failure than reviewing a large diff.
 *
 * What survives is the part that is about blast radius rather than trust:
 * authentication, credential handling, GitHub Actions workflows, release
 * automation, and dependency installation need a maintainer to sponsor the
 * change before it merges. `MAINTAINERS.md` already requires security review for
 * exactly these; this makes the requirement visible on the pull request instead
 * of relying on a reviewer noticing.
 *
 * It applies to EVERY contributor, not only first-timers. A maintainer with push
 * permission is exempt because their own review is the sponsorship.
