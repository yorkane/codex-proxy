# Credits

When a maintainer lands another author's pull request by reimplementing,
carrying, or rebasing it, the resulting commit is authored by the maintainer.
The contributor's name survives only through a `Co-authored-by` trailer — that
trailer is what GitHub reads for the contributor graph, the repository's
contributor list, and the author's own profile activity.

Some of those landings carry the trailer. Others state the debt in the commit
body and omit it:

```
  53c09a247  "Clean reimplementation of #3193"   Co-authored-by: alan7629 ...
  5734a1caf  "Reimplements #2797 by @rrmlima."   (no contributor trailer)
```

Both sentences are equally sincere. Only the first is data.

The commits below are inside published release tags and behind branch rulesets
that block force-pushes, so the trailers cannot be added retroactively without
invalidating every tag and clone —
[`MAINTAINERS.md`](./MAINTAINERS.md) states the same principle in the other
direction: authorship credit in git history is not rewritten. This file is the
forward repair.

Every entry cites the maintainer's own words from the closing comment or the
landing commit. Nothing here is inferred from a diff.

This file is **not** a contributor list. Most contributions merged normally,
with authorship intact, and need no entry. Absence from this page means the
ordinary path worked.

## Report and diagnosis

These fixes exist because of the report. The branch's own approach was not the
vehicle, and each author was told why at the time — recording them as carried
code would misstate what happened in the other direction.

## Closed as landed, carry not stated

Two more were closed with a landing commit and nothing further. The landing is
recorded; what was taken is not, and inventing an answer would be the same
inaccuracy this file exists to correct.

- [#3020](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/3020) by
  [@luvs01](https://github.com/luvs01) — closed "Landed via #3119 at `a73a4c998`".
- [#2675](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/2675) by
  [@Ingwannu](https://github.com/Ingwannu) — closed "Landed via #2677 at `8412fe156`".

## How this stays accurate

This page is a repair, not a process. The process is
`missing_coauthor_credit` in
[`.github/scripts/pr-hygiene.cjs`](./.github/scripts/pr-hygiene.cjs): a pull
request whose own text says it reimplements, supersedes, carries, or rebases
another author's pull request fails the hygiene gate until a
`Co-authored-by` trailer names that author. New entries here should be
unnecessary.

If you find a landing that belongs on this page, open an issue. Being missed is
the defect this file documents, not a claim you have to argue for.

### A gap the gate does not close

The gate checks that a trailer is **present**. It cannot check that the trailer
resolves to the account it names.

A 2026-09-04 backlog review found carry PR
[#3374](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/3374), carrying
[#3333](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/3333) by
[@blackjune67](https://github.com/blackjune67), with:

```
Co-authored-by: hajune <contributor@work-domain.example.test>
```

(The address is masked here — `privacy:scan` blocks real contributor emails in the
tree. What matters is its shape: a personal work address, not a GitHub-linked one.)

That is the git identity on the contributor's own commits, so it looks correct
in every review. But GitHub attributes co-authors by **account-linked** email,
and that address is linked to no account — so the trailer would have credited
nobody, and the contributor would have been invisible on their own patch. The
gate passed it, because a trailer was there.

It was corrected before the merge to the contributor's account-linked
`users.noreply.github.com` address, which is why there is no table row for it above.

The lesson generalizes: when carrying work, take the trailer address from the
author's GitHub account (the numeric-id `users.noreply.github.com` form is always
safe), not from the commit metadata on their branch. A contributor who commits
under a work email is the normal case, not an edge case.
