 * `src/codex/data/upstream-models.json` now pins the real row, so this slug is SELF-DESCRIBED
 * and must not borrow another model's capability metadata.
 *
 * Still NOT wire-normalized: unlike Daybreak the slug IS the wire id.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT account-gated (owner decision, 2026-09-04, reaffirmed during rollout).
 * Upstream `available_in_plans` lists 23 plans including `free`, but the model is rolling out,
 * so a given account's Codex surface may still answer
 * `"The 'gpt-6-astra' model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account."`
 * — the same refusal Daybreak returns. Gating on an entitlement roster would hide the row until
 * that roster catches up; listing it means the request dispatches and the real upstream status
 * is what the user sees. Evidence: devlog/_plan/260904_astra_release_alignment/021.
