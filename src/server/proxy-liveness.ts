// an adversarial or malformed body can never count as ready:
//
//  - HTTP 200 is required for status="ready"; HTTP 503 is required for pending
//    or failed. Any other HTTP/body-status pairing is an invalid contract.
//  - body.service must be exactly "opencodex".
//  - body.version must be a non-empty string.
//  - body.uptime must be a finite nonnegative number.
//  - body.pid must be a positive integer; when `expectedPid` is supplied it must
//    match exactly.
//  - body.port must be an integer in 1..65535 and equal the probed port.
//  - body.status must be exactly one of pending|ready|failed.
//
// Any unreachable, foreign, legacy, malformed, mismatched, or self-inconsistent
// response returns `null` so callers can never treat an invalid identity/contract
// as ready.
