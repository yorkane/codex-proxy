# Runtime SOT

## Entrypoints

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `bin/ocx.mjs` | Published npm `bin` entry (Node shim). Resolves the bundled or explicit Bun binary before project dotenv can load, stamps its runtime provenance plus a proof-bound Anthropic parent-env snapshot, lazy-runs `bun/install.js` if only the placeholder stub is present, then execs `src/cli/index.ts` under Bun. Lets `npm install -g` work without a separately-installed Bun. The exact `system codex-cli-update` inspection namespace skips both boot repair and lazy Bun installation; missing runtime support fails closed instead of mutating state. |
| `src/lib/bun-runtime.ts` | Bundled-Bun resolution: `isRealBunBinary()` (size gate vs the ~450-byte placeholder stub), `bundledBunPath()`, and `durableBunPath()` (path baked into service/shim artifacts). Durable selection accepts only the source/path pair already stamped for the running executable; it never re-reads a project-dotenv `OPENCODEX_BUN_PATH`. |
| `src/cli/index.ts` | `ocx` / `opencodex` CLI. Lifecycle: init, start, stop, restart, status, sync, restore/eject, gui, service, update. Configuration: provider, account, models, combo/route, access, integrations, v2. Client launchers: Claude, OpenCode, MiniMax Code, and MiniMax CLI text. The MMX launcher owns a child-lifetime loopback path bridge from the client's hard-coded `/anthropic/v1/messages` path to the canonical `/v1/messages` data plane; the server does not expose an extra auth surface. Diagnostics: doctor, debug, observe, health. Windows adds tray. The full command surface is `src/cli/help.ts`; this table names the groups, not every verb. After help/version early exits, ordinary commands run the bounded best-effort Codex-shim auto-restore policy before dispatch. `system codex-cli-update` is the deliberate read-only exception and suppresses auto-restore for its whole namespace, including malformed invocations. Keeps the `#!/usr/bin/env bun` shebang for from-source dev (`bun run src/cli/index.ts`). |
| `src/server/index.ts` | Bun server entrypoint: `startServer`, `/v1/responses` HTTP + WebSocket routing (compact handled before generic Responses), exact `POST /v1/images/generations` and `POST /v1/images/edits` routing, `/v1/models`, the Anthropic-shaped `/v1/messages` and OpenAI-shaped `/v1/chat/completions` compatibility surfaces, the Live/Realtime surface, the hosted-search relay, artifact serving, `/healthz`, the `/api/*` auth gate, the `/v1/*` JSON 404 guard, GUI fallback, the opt-in loopback-only hub-management listener, and facade re-exports for split server modules. |
| `src/server/images.ts` | Standalone Images data plane: default OpenAI or explicit custom-provider selection, Codex account affinity, bounded opaque request relay, single-attempt upstream fetch, pool health recording, and safe response/cancellation relay. |
| `src/config.ts` | Persisted `~/.opencodex/config.json` schema, defaults, migrations, transactions, and compatibility re-exports for split config modules. |
| `src/config/paths.ts` | Resolves `OPENCODEX_HOME`, `config.json`, and owner-only directory hardening. |
| `src/config/atomic-write.ts` | Shared synchronous/asynchronous temp-harden-rename writer and residual-temp failure contract. |
| `src/config/process-state.ts` | Owns `ocx.pid`, `runtime-port.json`, cheap liveness, full command-line identity verification, and snapshot-guarded cleanup. |
| `src/router.ts` | Provider/model selection before adapter dispatch. |
| `src/types.ts` | Shared config, parsed request, adapter, and event types. |
| `src/reasoning-effort.ts` | Codex reasoning-level definitions (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`), per-model effort mapping, and catalog effort sanitization. |
| `src/codex/shim.ts` | Codex autostart shim: replaces the `codex` binary with a wrapper that auto-starts the proxy on demand. It skips startup for management subcommands even when value-taking global flags precede the subcommand, and transactionally restores complete, stable external launcher replacements without a watcher or PATH rediscovery. |
| `src/service.ts` | OS service manager (macOS launchd, Linux systemd, Windows schtasks): always-on proxy with crash restart. |

The `src/` root stays thin: process entry (`src/cli.ts`, `src/index.ts`), shared config/types,
router, bridge, service manager, reasoning-effort definitions, and the stall-timeout budget live
there. Feature code is grouped by responsibility:

| Group | Directories |
| --- | --- |
| Data plane | `src/adapters/`, `src/responses/`, `src/chat/`, `src/claude/`, `src/grok/`, `src/images/`, `src/vision/`, `src/web-search/` |
| Codex integration | `src/codex/`, `src/combos/`, `src/providers/`, `src/oauth/` |
| Surfaces | `src/server/`, `src/cli/`, `src/tray/`, `src/github/` |
| Evidence and contracts | `src/compatibility/`, `src/lab/` |
| Support | `src/lib/`, `src/storage/`, `src/usage/`, `src/update/`, `src/generated/` |

`src/generated/` is build output committed for the runtime; it is not edited by hand.

`src/server/` is split by responsibility: `index.ts` owns the listener and route ordering;
`responses.ts` owns Responses handling and compaction; `images.ts` owns the standalone Images relay;
`responses/codex-auth-error.ts` owns the shared Responses/compact Codex auth-context HTTP mapping,
while account selection, credential materialization, logging, and transport stay in their existing handlers;
`management-api.ts` owns `/api/*`;
`lifecycle.ts`, `request-log.ts`, `relay.ts` (incl. the shared `createSseInspector` SSE inspection
factory), `relay-eager.ts` (#314 gated eager bounded passthrough relay), `memory-watchdog.ts`
(warn-only RSS sampler), `management/system-routes.ts` (`/api/system/*`), and `auth-cors.ts` own
server infrastructure (`src/lib/bun-stream-caps.ts` owns the Bun stream-capability gate); and
static GUI, WebSocket bridge, port/liveness, decompression, and adapter-resolution helpers live in
their own files.

## Lifecycle

`ocx start` refuses a duplicate PID, starts the proxy, writes `~/.opencodex/ocx.pid` and
`runtime-port.json` through `src/config/process-state.ts`, syncs Codex config/catalog, then serves
until shutdown. Normal shutdown restores native Codex. Service mode sets
`OCX_SERVICE=1`, so managed restarts do not repeatedly restore/reinject; explicit service stop and
uninstall still restore.

`startServer` composes up to three sockets in one synchronous startup transaction: the public data
listener, the optional unauthenticated data-loopback listener, and the optional hub-management
listener. The hub-management socket is enabled only by `runtimeRole: "hub"` plus
`hub.managementIngress.enabled`, always binds `127.0.0.1`, and default-denies everything except GUI,
session bootstrap/exchange, and `/api/*`. A failed optional bind initiates rollback of every earlier
socket; normal stop joins all bound sockets before lifecycle release. The existing launchd/systemd
installer remains the service owner and continues loading the data token from `service-api-token`;
hub mode adds no service-manager fork and no token-bearing unit/plist field.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Give a headless hub a browser management ingress without widening its data plane or trusting spoofable forwarding headers on the public listener.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: `startServer` is synchronous through Lab activation, already owns an optional-listener transaction, and the service installer already has an owner-only token-file flow.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Add management routes to the public listener; infer trusted ingress from `Host`/`Forwarded`/Tailscale headers; create a separate service manager; extend the existing composition root.
- 선택한 방식: Bind a third socket exactly to `127.0.0.1`, select trust by receiving `Bun.serve` instance, keep a fixed route allowlist, and reuse the current launchd/systemd definitions.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: Headers do not prove which transport received a request, while a kernel loopback bind plus Tailscale Serve supplies a concrete ingress boundary without duplicating lifecycle or secret delivery.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Public/default behavior stays unchanged and management can use Tailscale identity; operators must provide a co-located HTTPS frontend and pairing remains necessary for generic TLS proxies.

The process-state boundary deliberately exposes two PID checks. `readAlivePid()` is the cheap
non-destructive probe used by liveness polling. `readPid()` and `verifyPidIdentity()` include the
fixed-path command-line check required before stop, kill, port reclaim, or stale-state deletion.
Callers must not replace the latter with the former merely to avoid the Windows WMIC/PowerShell
probe. Expected-PID and snapshot removal helpers are the TOCTOU boundary when a replacement proxy
can write new state during a probe.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Separate proxy process ownership from persisted configuration without changing lifecycle behavior.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: `src/config.ts` mixed config transactions with cross-platform PID identity, runtime-port attestation, and stale-state cleanup; process writes still require the same config-home and atomic-write protections.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Keep the mixed module; create a process-state module that imports `config.ts`; duplicate atomic writes inside the new module; split the minimal path and atomic-write foundations first.
- 선택한 방식: `paths.ts` and `atomic-write.ts` are dependency leaves, `process-state.ts` depends only on those leaves, and `config.ts` remains a compatibility facade.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: Importing the facade would create a cycle, while duplicated writes could drift on ACL, symlink, residual-secret, and atomic-sequence behavior.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Lifecycle callers have a narrow owner and behavior remains characterized; the temporary facade and three small config modules add files but preserve downstream imports.

An installed Codex shim is checked on ordinary CLI startup with a regular-file/1 MiB state bound plus
bounded metadata and prefix reads. A complete replacement must produce identical fingerprints and
prefixes across a 100 ms observation interval; changing launchers are silently deferred, while mixed
sibling sets warn and defer as a unit. Guarded repair holds a self-identifying atomic-mkdir
interprocess lock across its final revalidation, rename, shim write, and state commit. Its owner record
uses the unique token as the filename, so stale-owner deletion cannot name a successor's record. An
aged lock is reclaimed only when its owner PID is no longer alive and the same token, lock-directory
identity, and owner fingerprint are still present immediately before deletion. Repair preflights every
tracked sibling before mutation and rolls back earlier siblings in reverse order on a later race.
Failures warn without changing the requested command's exit behavior. The probe uses read-only config
diagnostics only for a confirmed candidate and never reads adjacent auth state.

Codex CLI update inspection is split from mutation. `system codex-cli-update check` makes no
package-registry request and reads bounded provenance evidence for the configured launcher candidate, npm ownership layout,
package metadata, and shim binding. The proof-bound launcher snapshot does not attest successful Codex execution;
environment and persisted candidates remain report-only and cannot produce a managed classification in this one-shot command.
On Windows this first slice performs no candidate/configuration filesystem I/O: it preserves only proof-captured
absolute environment candidates for lexical app-bundle/version-manager reporting and otherwise fails closed.
This check does not attest or admit a selected runtime. The command exposes no private mutation authority and does not query
a registry, execute Codex/npm, install, repair, stop, restart, or change configuration/cache state.

The bridge enforces a heartbeat stall deadline. It defaults to 300 seconds sampled on a 2 s tick
(`src/stall-timeout.ts`) and is configurable, so treat the number as a default rather than an
invariant; sidecars keep their own clocks. On expiry the stream is closed and the upstream request
cancelled. If the adapter generator ends without an explicit done/error event, the response is marked
`incomplete` rather than `completed` so Codex can distinguish a clean finish from a truncated stream.
On `error` / incomplete / stall / EOF — and when assembled non-freeform tool arguments fail to parse —
an open tool call is cancelled as `status: "incomplete"` without `function_call_arguments.done`, so
the client never sees a completed call ahead of `response.failed` / `response.incomplete`.

The server exposes `POST /api/stop` which restores native Codex config, stops any installed service
(to prevent respawn), and exits the process. The GUI sidebar stop button calls this endpoint.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Prevent repository dotenv data from becoming a durable executable or an OAuth-bearing Claude destination.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: Bun auto-loads project dotenv before OpenCodex TypeScript evaluates, while provider interpolation still depends on that behavior and cannot be disabled globally.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Reject only relative Bun paths; disable Bun dotenv; trust a plain environment marker; capture provenance in the Node launcher and bind it to an argv proof.
- 선택한 방식: The Node launcher selects Bun and snapshots Anthropic credential/destination slots before Bun starts. Durable runtime selection uses only the stamped current executable, while Claude accepts the snapshot only when its random argv proof matches.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: Absolute dotenv expansion bypasses a relative-path check, global dotenv removal breaks supported configuration, and an environment-only marker can itself come from dotenv.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Normal npm launches preserve genuine shell overrides. Direct Bun or legacy launches have no provenance signal and fail closed for all three ambient Anthropic slots — credentials included, because subscription mode leaves `CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MANAGED_BY_HOST` unset by design (#253) and a `settings.env` merge can still replace the destination after launch, so a preserved key would travel with it. The cost is that `bun src/cli/index.ts` loses ambient Anthropic values; the escape hatch is running through the published `ocx` bin, where genuine shell exports are preserved by proof. Durable artifacts use the running or bundled Bun.

## Providers and adapters

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/providers/registry.ts` | Canonical provider presets for CLI, dashboard, OAuth, key providers, and metadata. |
| `src/providers/derive.ts` | Enrichment from provider presets into user config. |
| `src/oauth/` | OAuth providers, token storage, refresh, and auth-token resolution. |
| `src/adapters/openai-responses.ts` | Native OpenAI/ChatGPT Responses passthrough. |
| `src/adapters/openai-chat.ts` | OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions bridge. |
| `src/adapters/anthropic.ts` | Anthropic Messages bridge. |
| `src/adapters/google.ts` | Gemini bridge. |
| `src/adapters/azure.ts` | Azure OpenAI bridge. |
| `src/adapters/cursor.ts`, `src/adapters/cursor/` | Cursor protobuf transport: discovery, request builder, event decoding, MCP, thread continuity, native-exec policy. |
| `src/adapters/kiro.ts` and its `src/adapters/kiro-*.ts` helpers | Kiro event/tool/thinking/truncation/retry handling. |
| `src/adapters/mimo-free.ts` | Mimo Free transport (client identity + JWT). |
| `src/adapters/image.ts`, `src/adapters/anthropic-image-guard.ts`, `src/adapters/anthropic-image-normalize.ts` | Image conversion for adapter ingress and Anthropic-specific normalization/limits. |
| `src/adapters/run-turn-queue.ts`, `src/adapters/tool-catalog-nudge.ts`, `src/adapters/identity.ts`, `src/adapters/upstream-http-error.ts` | Shared adapter execution support: turn queueing, tool-catalog nudging, client identity, upstream error normalization. |

Adapter output must stay in internal `AdapterEvent` form until `bridge.ts` converts it back to
Responses SSE or WebSocket frames.

Live model discovery is bounded and registry-driven through `src/providers/model-discovery.ts`.
Custom providers keep the conventional `${baseUrl}/models` request; canonical presets may select a
trusted URL/path/query and declarative eligibility filter without persisting that policy into user
config. A response is rejected before caching when it exceeds 4 MiB, contains more than 2,000 raw
rows, has a malformed OpenAI list envelope, or includes an invalid model id. Tests use fixtures and
must never depend on live provider endpoints. Newly promoted fixed key presets opt into
`preserveCustomDestination`, so an older same-named custom provider keeps its configured adapter,
destination, and key boundary instead of being silently canonicalized onto the new host. Fixed
OAuth presets resolve discovery against the same canonical registry transport as normal routing
before any adapter-specific transport override, so a stale configured `baseUrl` cannot receive an
OAuth bearer token.

## Remote Hub hardening ownership

`src/remote/protocol.ts` owns pure interval/feature negotiation. `src/client/hub-client.ts` owns bounded, schema-validated remote catalog consumption and key-id probes. `src/client/hub-relay.ts` is a fixed-authority management relay with URL, header, body, redirect, and stream bounds. The public data listener remains the direct client→hub path; the loopback management ingress never serves data-plane routes.
