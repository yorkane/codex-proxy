## Transformation contract

NEW files carry the complete immutable source body. For moved tests, rewrite source imports `../src/` to `../../src/`, helper imports `./helpers/` to `../helpers/`, and obsolete fake-server paths to their current fixture owner. Register every new test in both layout.json explicit and test-layout-expected.json. Source-file reads and subprocess fixture paths use tests/helpers/repo-root.ts. Shared existing files take only source PR hunks, preserving all newer dev behavior; resolve conflicts against the named owner before writing. All original adopted implementation receives the coauthor trailer.

Port original src/server/index.ts admission and WebSocket handlers into current owners after reading current decomposition. Keep runtimeRole=hub and no-Origin checks before lazy workspace imports. Browser mutations require gui-session. Pair exchange retains 32KiB bounded read, kernel-peer limiter and one-time device token. Add remote-workspace branch to all WsData consumers (open/message/close) with disconnect cleanup. Shutdown only touches already initialized workspace instances. Never import workspace modules from router.ts, lifecycle.ts or responses/core.ts.

CLI registration now also needs src/cli/capabilities.ts and generated skills/ocx surface sync. GUI follows current App routing, nav structure and all locale dictionaries; preserve existing browser consent and error handling. User docs distinguish provider gateway Remote Hub from executor Remote Workspace. Current structure ownership docs receive concise source-appropriate updates without copying obsolete numbered docs.

Reachable negatives: non-hub invocation; Origin-bearing pair/upgrade; missing/malformed/revoked bearer; admin-token attempt at dashboard mutation; excessive pairing body; ten invalid code attempts; unknown session/device/root; offline status and unavailable runtime. Original management/server tests plus new activation-isolation source guard must observe refusals and no optional activation. UI uses deterministic mocked API rendering, no live pairing. Screenshot must be generated/observed by an authorized renderer; absent render evidence is recorded as NOT VERIFIED, never borrowed from original screenshot.

## Data and enforcement chain

Required acceptance (not an established property of the pinned source): identity/capability creation comes from protocol builders and device root approval; serializers carry bounded versioned messages; strict parsers recover them; handshake/coordinator/executor consumers enforce capabilities and roots. GUI only displays public state. Tier: runtime boundary; executing surface: parser/auth/executor code. Known bypass: a process with the operator account can invoke host tools directly. Residual: local operator compromise is outside this process boundary. Wording: bounded remote tools, no claim of host-user isolation. Final layer for commands: OS confinement probe; unavailable means exec is not advertised.

## Verification and rollback

Local tests/build/typecheck/install NOT RUN by user instruction. Text comparison and git diff --check observe this change but are not product tests. Existing hosted CI command definitions are inspected before dispatch; final SHA evidence is recorded in phase 4. Revert this layer before its parent; no persistent state migrations are performed by this carry task.

## Explicit activation REMOTE-ARCH-005

NEW src/remote-control/workspace-activation.ts exports a side-effect-free guard requiring runtimeRole=hub AND process.env.OCX_REMOTE_WORKSPACE_ENABLED === "1". This guard imports only the config type. Pair and agent branches call it before dynamic import; disabled requests return 404. Management namespace returns a disabled status before importing runtime. Shutdown uses already retained workspace references or initialized-only lazy import only when explicitly enabled; a disabled Hub never creates identity or probes model CLIs. CLI pairing remains explicit Executor-local authorization and never modifies server environment. Document the opt-in variable and require an explicit environment choice to enable the feature. Test disabled Hub, non-Hub with flag, and enabled Hub, with no ambient inheritance in fixtures.

Existing-file conflicts observed by git apply --check: management-api.ts, management/context.ts and ws-bridge.ts. Port the namespace-dispatch addition into current management handler, append only type/dependency seam fields after current imports, and extend current WebSocket discriminator/handlers without replacing newer fields. The check was text applicability only, not a product test.

## Phase-3 revalidation

Previous D: runtime source cycle closed at a3182185f0 after corrected whitespace receipt. Final executable/native proof remains open; Windows commands unsupported. Continue integration from that exact parent. Carry current React resource/Select/Notice/icon conventions with no dependency additions. All locales inherit original translations with the unavailable-state opt-in message added consistently.

Server adaptation: preserve current quota-reset and Grok coupon lazy dispatch. Add remote namespace handler before normal configuration routes. It answers disabled GET status with available:false and empty collections before loading workspace runtime; mutations when disabled refuse. Pair/agent paths require explicit guard before lazy imports and existing Origin/device-token validation. WebSocket data stores only structural receive/open/close callbacks; no concrete Hub class imports in ws-bridge. Upgrade closure owns hub/device association and close cleanup. Management dependency seams use structural Pick projections of only public Hub/session operations; all are import type and erased at runtime. Runtime modules use narrow config imports from phase 2, eliminating the prior broad runtime cycle.

Shutdown: a promise-local initialized workspace module reference is set only on actual workspace route activation; shutdown calls initialized service getters only when that reference exists. It never dynamically imports remote runtime merely because runtimeRole is hub. Management-only activation also needs lifecycle-owned shutdown registration or a retained optional shutdown callback; resolve before B and test both paths.

NEW tests/clients/remote-workspace-activation.test.ts covers hub+flag guard, disabled management status without store writes and unauthorized principal refusal before dependency construction. Existing server tests get explicit isolated flag setup/restore; no real devices. CLI capabilities list pair/agent/status, no Hub-status automation introduced. Regenerate skills/ocx reference surface through its existing generator (documentation only). Docs state OCX_REMOTE_WORKSPACE_ENABLED=1 opt-in, default read-only sessions, Linux conditional exec and both desktop native helpers refusing commands.

Rendering: this worktree has no node_modules or gui/node_modules. Do not install or run a local build. Prefer final hosted package artifacts for a local static render with synthetic API responses; if no artifact exists, retain rendering as unmet acceptance and attach no historical screenshot as current evidence.

### Awaited per-server cleanup decision

The existing optional-shutdown registry is synchronous best-effort and cannot prove awaited Remote Workspace shutdown. Reuse server.stop's existing runListenerShutdown array instead. Add a per-server retained shutdown callback and a ManagementApiDeps onRemoteWorkspaceShutdown callback setter. Workspace management resolves its already-loaded services then registers an initialized-only cleanup closure through that setter; pair/agent loader registers the same kind of closure. server.stop calls the retained callback if present. No callback means no remote import/work. Keep registration idempotent and closure references scoped to the current config/server; tests cover management-only initialization and explicit stop. Do not change the global optional-shutdown API.

In-flight initialization refinement: management checks per-server stopping before and after module import, creates Hub/session services synchronously in one turn, then registers initialized-only teardown. Pair/upgrade paths check stopping after lazy load. SessionService rejects create/resume after shutdown even when an availability promise completes later; a regression holds availability across shutdown. This prevents request initialization from creating resources after stop.

Source-audit follow-up: pending creation promises and late handle cleanup are owned by shutdown, which settles all session cleanups before propagating failure. Pair-body completion rechecks stop admission. UI derives enrollment commands from the actual shared Hub origin, keeps drafts per session, preserves newer input on failure, shares submission eligibility between keyboard/button, warns on stale snapshots, and permits Stop during pairing. Controlled runtime/body/draft/Stop regressions accompany these adaptations; execution remains hosted-only.
