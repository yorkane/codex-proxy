/**
 * Brand mark per client. Only a real asset belongs here; a client with none
 * falls back to a monogram tile rather than borrowing another product's logo.
 * Separate from `provider-icons.ts` on purpose: export-client ids and provider
 * ids are unrelated namespaces that happen to share the string "opencode".
 *
 * Every entry is the product's OWN first-party asset, fetched and verified;
 * provenance per file is recorded in `gui/public/provider-icons/README.md`.
 *
 * `kimi` points at an asset already committed for the Moonshot provider, which
 * is the same brand as the Kimi Code client -- reusing it beats fetching a
 * second copy of one logo.
 *
 * `dsh` uses the DeepSeek Harness favicon rather than `deepseek-color.svg`: the
 * harness is first-party DeepSeek but it is a different product from the model
 * provider, and the provider logo would be a borrowed mark.
 *
 * `aside` is the one mark not taken from the web: Aside publishes no favicon.svg,
 * so its symbol comes out of the shipping application, where the vendor names the
 * module `official-brand-symbol`. Still first-party, just not fetched.
 *
 * Three are traced rather than fetched, because their vendors publish no usable
 * vector: `hermes` from the Hermes desktop application icon, `gajae` from the
 * Gajae mascot PNG. A trace follows the source pixels -- it is not a redraw --
 * and the conversion parameters are in the README beside the source URL, so the
 * result can be reproduced. What is still refused: squeezing a horizontal
 * wordmark into this square slot, and a full-frame silhouette plate that renders
 * as a filled box at 20px. Both candidates existed and both were rejected;
 * `devlog/_plan/260831_aside_client_and_integrations_ux/005_remaining_marks_provenance.md`
 * names them.

 *
 * Without this each of them disappears against one of the two themes: `prime`
 * ships white-on-transparent and vanishes in light mode, while `opencode`
 * (#211E1E) and `kimi` (#1A1A1A) vanish in dark. That is not hypothetical -- a
 * rendered check of every mark showed `prime` blank on white and `opencode` and
 * `kimi` blank on #0d1117. `hermes` joined them the same way: its traced
 * artwork is one ink, and a 20px render on #0d1117 showed nothing at all.
 *
 * A multi-color mark must never be listed here: masking discards its colors and
 * would flatten a brand palette into one ink. That is why `gajae` (seven traced
 * layers) and `mcode` (a three-stop gradient) stay images despite arriving in
 * the same pass as `hermes`.
