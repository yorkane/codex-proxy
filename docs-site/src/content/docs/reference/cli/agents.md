title: CLI Agents, Routing, and Integrations
description: Multi-agent, combo, observability, access, protocol path, integration, system, and config commands.
---

These commands control agent policy and routing, inspect the live proxy, and connect supported clients to opencodex.

## Agent policy

### `ocx agent <status|injection|effort|subagents|fallback|sidecar> ...`

Manage the headless multi-agent roster, effort caps, prompt injection, fallback, and sidecar settings.
Use `status` for the current policy. See [Sub-agent surfaces](/guides/sub-agent-surface/) for how
surface modes, delegation, effort, and fallback behavior fit together.

```bash
ocx agent subagents set ark/model-a,openai/gpt-5.5
```

`ocx agent sidecar web --list` and `ocx agent sidecar vision --list` print the models the
server currently offers for each sidecar — the exact filtered set the dashboard picker shows
(picker-visible rows plus the login-entitled Luna/Haiku auth slots, intersected with executor
availability for web search, minus provably text-only models for vision). Human-readable lists
show each model's backend in brackets. A web-search `--model` write resolves that server-offered
row and persists its backend and model together, so switching to an Anthropic option cannot keep
an OpenAI backend (or vice versa). Writes go to the same management route as the GUI and are
subject to the same per-sidecar gate: web search refuses a backend/model pair outside the listed
set (closed membership), while vision refuses only a model provably unable to see (unknown ids
stay writable).

```bash
ocx agent sidecar web --list
ocx agent sidecar web --model gpt-5.6-luna
ocx agent sidecar web --enabled off
```

`--enabled off` is the same switch as the Dashboard's Off row: OpenCodex stops running the
sidecar and the Codex integration writes `web_search = "disabled"` into `~/.codex/config.toml`,
which is what lets an MCP search server be the only search path. `--enabled on` removes that
marker-owned line again. When the save actually moves the switch, the command reports the
Codex-side write it triggered (`codexWebSearch` in `--json`, a trailing `Codex config:` line
otherwise) and points at `ocx sync` when it could not happen; a save that leaves the switch
where it was has nothing to report and prints no `Codex config:` line. The flag works for
`vision` too.

### `ocx effort [status|set|clear]`

Inspect or change main and subagent reasoning-effort caps through the live proxy, or the local
configuration when no proxy is available. Cap values are `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`,
and `ultra`; `-` clears the selected cap. `none` and `minimal` are not cap levels and are rejected
before probing the proxy or submitting an update, including when another option in the same command is valid.
They remain valid for `--injection`, which sets the separate injection effort rather than a cap.

```bash
ocx effort status --json
ocx effort set --main high --subagent low
ocx effort set --subagent -
```

Status preserves existing stored/runtime cap values and reports unsupported values in `warnings`
(an empty array when none are unsupported). The same warnings appear in human output and name the
field that is ignored with a correction command. Status never repairs or rewrites those values.
An ignored subagent field does not remove a valid main cap. `ocx effort clear` clears both caps
while retaining the separate injection-effort setting. See [Sub-agent surfaces](/guides/sub-agent-surface/)
for the request surfaces where caps apply.

### `ocx v2 <status|on|off|mode <v1|default|v2>|keep-native-v1 <on|off>|threads <n>|mode-hint <text|--clear>>`

Manage the Codex `multi_agent_v2` feature flag and the three-state multi-agent surface mode.

| Subcommand | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `status` (default) | Report the current v2 flag, multi-agent mode, and thread concurrency. |
| `on` | Enable the global `multi_agent_v2` feature and resync the catalog. Rejected while the v2 hybrid pin is active because the global override would defeat it. |
| `off` | Disable the `multi_agent_v2` feature and resync the catalog. |
| `mode v1` | Force all models to v1, disable native v2, and preserve the active thread limit. |
| `mode default` | Respect upstream model surface pins. |
| `mode v2` | Force models to v2 and preserve the active thread limit. With `keep-native-v1` off, enable global native v2; with it on, disable the global override and use catalog pins. |
| `keep-native-v1 on\|off` | Under `mode v2`, keep ChatGPT-native models on v1 and routed models on v2. Enabling it disables the global V2 override before catalog sync. |
| `threads <n>` | Set the active v1/v2 thread limit to an integer of at least 1. |
| `mode-hint <text>` | Set the Proactive delegation hint (Ultra mode) for every model and effort. |
| `mode-hint --clear` | Remove the hint so the effort-derived policy (ultra = proactive) resumes. |

```bash
ocx v2 status
ocx v2 mode v1
ocx v2 mode default
ocx v2 on
ocx v2 threads 16
ocx v2 mode-hint "Proactive multi-agent delegation is active."
ocx v2 mode-hint --clear
```

The `mode` subcommand writes `multiAgentMode` to the opencodex config and resyncs the Codex catalog.
Mode and flag transitions move the current numeric thread limit between the valid v1/v2 Codex keys;
a failed transition restores the original `config.toml`. Changes apply to new Codex sessions, while
running sessions keep their pinned surface.

Codex resolves an enabled global `multi_agent_v2` override before the selected model's catalog
pin. The hybrid `keep-native-v1` contract therefore keeps that global override off; otherwise a
native row stamped `v1` would still start on V2 and produce backend-encrypted child tasks.

`mode-hint` writes `features.multi_agent_v2.multi_agent_mode_hint_text` in Codex's
`$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` even when `multi_agent_v2` is currently disabled. The
command only persists the override; it does not enable or disable the feature, so
the hint takes effect when a matching Codex surface is active. The hint overrides
codex-rs's effort-derived multi-agent policy, so any model and any reasoning effort
receives the Proactive delegation prompt. It does **not** change reasoning effort
itself. A missing argument or a whitespace-only value is rejected; only `--clear`
removes the hint. The Subagents dashboard's Ultra mode **on** toggle has a stricter
gate: it requires the native feature to be enabled with an explicit v2 surface
(`ocx v2 mode v2`); `ocx v2 on` alone does not satisfy that dashboard gate.

## Combo routing

### `ocx combo <list|show|set|remove> ...` · `ocx route combo ...`

Manage combo failover and round-robin virtual models. `ocx route combo` is the hierarchical alias;
combo is currently the supported routing resource. Targets use
`provider/model[:weight],provider/model[:weight]`.

```bash
ocx combo list
ocx route combo set reliable --targets ark/model-a:2,openai/gpt-5.5
```

`set` accepts `--strategy`, `--sticky`, `--effort`, `--alias`, `--rename-from`, `--native-alias`, and
`--display-name <label|->` (`-` clears the label). A native alias captures only one currently supported,
unqualified bare OpenAI model id. Bare `gpt-5.6-*` native aliases use Codex Pool/Direct credentials.
Account-qualified OpenAI routes remain distinct, while provider-qualified routes such as
`openai-apikey/gpt-5.6-*` use their configured API key and never fall through to the native alias.
Read the safety and visibility contract in the guide before enabling the compatibility pair.

See [Combos](/guides/combos/) for routing behavior and configuration guidance.

## Observability and debug

### `ocx observe <logs|usage|storage|memory|debug|claude-inbound|injection> ...`

Inspect proxy requests, usage, storage, memory, and debug data. The direct aliases are:

| Alias | Equivalent resource |
| --- | --- |
| `ocx logs [filters] [--follow] [--json|--jsonl]` | `ocx observe logs` |
| `ocx usage [--range <today|1d|7d|30d|all>] [--since <timestamp> --until <timestamp>] [--surface <all|codex|claude|grok>] [--provider <name>] [--model <id>] [--json]` | `ocx observe usage` |
| `ocx storage [--json]` | `ocx observe storage` |
| `ocx memory [--json]` | `ocx observe memory` |

```bash
ocx observe usage --range 30d --json
ocx usage --since 2026-09-01T09:00:00Z --until 2026-09-01T10:59:59.999Z --json
```

`--since` and `--until` must be supplied together. They accept integer epoch milliseconds or
full ISO datetimes with an explicit timezone, include both endpoints, and override `--range`.
Invalid or reversed bounds fail before the request. Human output prints the requested interval;
`--json` includes `customWindow`, `since`, and `until`. Existing surface/provider/model filters
still apply. These commands query the running proxy; they do not provide offline reports.

`--range today` (alias `1d`) reports the current local day. `--provider` and
`--model` narrow the report to one upstream target — distinct from
`--surface`, which selects the calling client (Codex, Claude Code, Grok)
rather than the provider serving the request.

The default view prints request, token and estimated-cost totals plus
per-provider and per-model breakdowns. Costs are API list-price equivalents,
not a billing receipt: subscription plans and provider credits are billed
separately, and requests with no matching price row are counted as
`unpriced`/`unmetered` rather than folded in as zero.

```bash
ocx usage --range today --provider xai
```

When some usage records cannot be included, human output warns, including when there are zero readable rows.
Any displayed totals reflect readable records only. If a filter has no readable matches, the output shows
the warning and guidance instead of total lines; skipped records may contain matches.
`--json` preserves the response-level `usageIncomplete` diagnostic and reason.

### `ocx debug <provider|usage|injection|claude> <on|off|status|reset|logs [-f]>`

Read or change runtime debug overrides through the running proxy's management API.

```bash
ocx debug provider on|off|status|reset
ocx debug provider logs [-f|--follow]
ocx debug usage on|off|status|reset
ocx debug usage logs [-f|--follow]
```

With no scope, `ocx debug` prints usage and, when the proxy is stopped, the next-start environment
defaults. Provider debug defaults from `OCX_DEBUG=1` (legacy `OCX_DEBUG_FRAMES=1` also works); usage
debug defaults from `OPENCODEX_USAGE_DEBUG=1`.

## API access

### `ocx access <key|endpoints|models|test> ...`

Manage OpenCodex admission API keys and inspect external endpoints and models. `ocx api-key
<list|create|remove> ...` is an alias of `ocx access key`.

```bash
ocx access key create deployment
```

### `ocx api <protocols|explain|policy> ...`

Inspect and set how requests travel between the client APIs and provider wires. See
[Protocol paths](/guides/protocol-paths/) for the vocabulary.

| Command | Route | Changes state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ocx api protocols [--provider <name>] [--json]` | `GET /api/protocols` | No |
| `ocx api explain --model <id> --inbound <responses\|chat\|messages> [--feature <key>]... [--json]` | `POST /api/protocols/plan` | No |
| `ocx api policy [--json]` | `GET /api/protocols` | No |
| `ocx api policy [--messages <on\|off>] [--unrepresentable <legacy\|reject>] [--rollout <switch>=<on\|off>]... [--json]` | `PATCH /api/protocols/settings` | Yes |

- `protocols` prints the contract version, whether each client API is served and why, the
  unrepresentable policy, every rollout switch, and the policy revision. `--provider` adds the
  upstream wire that provider receives, who decided it, and the models on another wire.
- `explain` previews the path a model would take from one client API. `--feature` is repeatable
  and accepts a comma-separated list; `ocx api protocols --json` lists the known feature keys. The
  preview is computed from configuration: nothing is sent upstream, no combo rotation advances, and
  the input is not logged.
- `policy` without a setting flag only reads. With one it sends a single change to the running
  proxy, which validates it, saves the configuration, and answers with the new policy.
  `--messages off` also turns the Claude integration off, as the dashboard toggle does. Switch
  names and combinations are validated by the proxy; for example
  `--rollout managedMessagesNativeOAuth=on` is refused unless `managedMessagesNative` is
  already on or turned on in the same command.

```bash
ocx api explain --model combo/main --inbound chat --feature request.seed,request.tools
ocx api policy --rollout shadowPlan=on
```

Usage errors exit 2 before any request is sent. `--json` prints the management API body as is.

## Client integrations

### `ocx integration <claude|grok> ...`

Manage supported Claude and Grok integrations. The direct command families below expose their
client-specific controls.

### `ocx claude [claude args...]`

Ensure the proxy is running, then launch Claude Code with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1`, and model slots from
`config.claudeCode`. Routed models appear in the native `/model` picker through stable slot aliases
with Claude Code 2.1.129 or newer. On older versions, select with `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` or `/model <id>`.
User-exported `ANTHROPIC_*` variables always take precedence.

Claude Desktop profile commands are:

```text
ocx claude desktop [apply]                         Save and apply the four-family profile
ocx claude desktop show [--json]                   Show routes, families, and defaults
ocx claude desktop status [--json]                 Show applied state, drift, and health
ocx claude desktop move <route> <family> [--default]
ocx claude desktop default <family> <route|none>
ocx claude desktop export <path|->                 Export versioned JSON (`-` = stdout)
ocx claude desktop import <path> [--apply]         Validate and import JSON
```

The families are `opus`, `fable`, `sonnet`, and `haiku`; new routes start in `opus`. `none` is valid
only when that family is empty. Legacy apply flags `--static`, `--hybrid`, and `--discovery-only`
remain supported. Use `ocx claude config <status|set> ...` for Claude Code settings.

### `ocx opencode [opencode args...]`

Ensure the proxy is running, then launch opencode with the generated `provider.opencodex` and
`providers.opencodex` blocks in OpenCode's inline runtime layer (`OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`). The
legacy block keeps V1 clients working; the V2 block is the one carrying the selectable
reasoning-effort variants. Existing inline config is preserved and only those two keys are replaced
for this launch. Global or project `opencode.json` files may be read to warn about an existing
override, but on-disk files are never modified. Routed models appear as
`opencodex/<provider>/<model>`. Launching plain `opencode` later behaves exactly as before.

### `ocx grok <status|exclude|include|set|clear|apply> ...`

Manage and apply the Grok Build model fence.

## Client config export

### `ocx export --client <opencode|pi|omp|hermes|openclaw|kimi|gajae|dsh|mcode|zcode|prime|aside|raycast|omo>`

Print a client config wired to the running proxy. The command serializes the
`opencodex` provider block — base URL, model list, and the client's credential
reference or loopback placeholder — in the selected client's native format.

The proxy must be running; the command resolves its live port, reads `/api/models`, and emits only
models Codex can currently see.

| Flag | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `--client <opencode\|pi\|omp\|hermes\|openclaw\|kimi\|gajae\|dsh\|mcode\|zcode\|prime\|aside\|raycast\|omo>` | Required. Selects the client config dialect. |
| `--json` | Print the generated document as JSON on stdout for scripts. This is JSON even when the selected client's native format is YAML, TOML, or JSON5. |
| `--out <path>` | Write the client's native config format to `<path>`. Refuses to replace an existing file. |
| `--force` | Allow `--out` to replace an existing file. |

```bash
ocx export --client opencode                     # config plus destination, merge warning, and counts
ocx export --client pi --json > pi-models.json   # JSON document for a pipe or a diff
ocx export --client omp --out ./omp-models.yml    # native OMP YAML
ocx export --client opencode --out ~/opencodex-opencode.json
```

Without `--json` the generated config leads, then the canonical destination path, the merge warning, the env
export line where the client has one, and a model count with how many rows omit context limits (the
client applies its own defaults for those).

| Client | Canonical destination | Download filename | Env var |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `opencode` | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` wins when set) | `opencode.json` | `OPENCODEX_OPENCODE_API_KEY` |
| `pi` | `~/.pi/agent/models.json` (`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` wins when set; a relative value is refused) | `pi-models.json` | none — the block carries the literal `opencodex-loopback` |
| `omp` | `~/.omp/agent/models.yml` (`OMP_PROFILE` wins over `PI_PROFILE`, even when empty; named profiles use the home-relative `PI_CONFIG_DIR` directory name and ignore `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, while the default profile lets `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` win) | `omp-models.yaml` | none — loopback placeholder |
| `hermes` | `~/.hermes/config.yaml` | `hermes-config.yaml` | `OPENCODEX_HERMES_API_KEY` |
| `openclaw` | `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` | `openclaw.json5` | `OPENCODEX_OPENCLAW_API_KEY` |
| `kimi` | `~/.kimi-code/config.toml` | `kimi-config.toml` | none — loopback placeholder |
| `gajae` | `~/.gjc/agent/models.yml` | `gajae-models.yaml` | non-secret loopback placeholder |
| `dsh` | `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml` (default `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`) | `settings.yaml` | none — non-secret loopback bearer placeholder |
| `mcode` | `~/.minimax/config.yaml` (`MINIMAX_DATA_DIR`, then the legacy `MAVIS_DATA_DIR`, win when set; a relative value is refused) | `mcode-config.yaml` | none — loopback placeholder |
| `zcode` | `~/.zcode/v2/config.json` (`ZCODE_DATA_DIR` wins when set; a relative value is refused) | `config.json` | none — loopback placeholder |
| `prime` | `~/.prime/agent/models.json` (`PRIME_AGENT_CODING_AGENT_DIR` wins when set; a relative value is refused) | `prime-models.json` | none — loopback placeholder |
| `aside` | `~/.aside/u/<account>/models.json` for the account Aside's own `accounts.json` names as current; an unreadable manifest is refused rather than defaulting to an account | `aside-models.json` | none — loopback placeholder |
| `raycast` | `~/.config/raycast/ai/providers.yaml` on macOS and Windows alike (Raycast does not honor `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) | `raycast-providers.yaml` | none — loopback only, no `api_keys` entry is written |
| `omo` | `~/.omo/agent/models.json` (`OMO_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, then `SENPI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, then `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` win in that order when set; a relative value is refused) | `omo-models.json` | none — loopback placeholder |

The managed DSH export requires DSH 0.1.0-rc.6 or newer and owns only
`llm-pi-ai.providers.opencodex`. DSH hot reloads that provider; the user's default model and
`deepseek-official` remain untouched. This export is loopback-only and carries no real credential.

opencode interpolates `{env:OPENCODEX_OPENCODE_API_KEY}`. The generated Pi and OMP exports do
not require an environment variable: each carries the literal `opencodex-loopback` placeholder.
This is load-bearing because both clients resolve `apiKey` while building their model lists and
hide the whole provider when an existing config contains an unset env reference. The proxy never
checks the generated placeholder on loopback. OMP supports provider-level headers, but this initial
integration deliberately remains loopback-only; remote `x-opencodex-api-key` wiring is deferred.

The Raycast export is a standalone `providers.yaml` document with one `id: opencodex` element
in the `providers` sequence: `name: OpenCodex`, the proxy's `/v1` base URL, and every routed model
with its `abilities` (`tools` and `system_message` always supported, `vision` from the catalog's
input modalities, `reasoning_effort` when the model has an effort ladder, `temperature` off for
reasoning models). Custom Providers is a Raycast Pro feature, and Raycast watches the file, so a
saved change takes effect without a restart. The format is documented at
[manual.raycast.com/ai/custom-providers](https://manual.raycast.com/ai/custom-providers). No
`api_keys` entry is written, so this export is loopback-only and a non-loopback bind is refused.

The MCode, ZCode and Prime exports are loopback-only for the same reason and likewise carry the
`opencodex-loopback` placeholder rather than a real credential. Prime Agent reads the same
`models.json` contract Pi does, so the two exports produce the same document; only the destination
differs. A relative path in any of those three environment overrides is refused, because the proxy
and the client can have different working directories and would otherwise disagree about which
file is meant.

ZCode 3.8.1 may save runtime-derived `reasoning`, `limit.output`, and default context metadata back
into the generated `provider.opencodex.models` entries. Managed integration status treats only
those documented additions as refreshable drift. Provider identity and connection settings,
including `options.baseURL`, model membership, names, modalities, and any context limit OpenCodex
emitted authoritatively remain protected; editing them reports `conflict / foreign-edit` instead of
overwriting the file. An ownership record created by an older OpenCodex version can recover
automatically when the generated catalog is otherwise unchanged. If both the catalog and the block
changed, re-apply only after reviewing the file because the older record cannot prove which change
was ZCode-derived.

:::caution[Merge, never replace]
`ocx export` never writes your real client config. The destination is printed for you to merge by
hand, and `--out` refuses to overwrite an existing file without `--force`, because replacing a
config destroys the other providers, agents, and MCP entries already in it.
:::

No key is ever serialized. Configs carry either a documented environment reference or a
non-secret loopback placeholder. A loopback proxy (`127.0.0.1`, the default) requires no
admission key at all. Set a referenced variable only when the client schema supports it and
the proxy binds beyond loopback; see
[Remote access](/reference/configuration/server/#remote-access) for how admission keys are issued. Keys for
the upstream providers themselves are a separate thing entirely, configured per
[Providers](/guides/providers/).
The generated gjc integration uses a non-secret loopback placeholder and needs no environment variable. It remains loopback-only; it does not configure remote admission credentials.

The same payload is served by `GET /api/client-config` and rendered on the dashboard's API tab, so
the CLI, the API, and the GUI use the same bytes.

## Runtime and configuration

### `ocx system <status|settings|startup|diagnostics|sync|codex-app-server|codex-restart|update|codex-cli-update> ...`

Manage headless runtime settings, startup, sync, diagnostics, and updates.

`ocx system codex-restart --yes` restarts Codex app-servers and fully quits and relaunches the
Codex desktop app, through the same module as `ocx sync --restart-codex`. When the proxy itself
is running inside the Codex app, the command refuses with an actionable message instead of
promising a handoff it cannot complete.

```bash
ocx system settings --stream-mode eager-relay
```

`ocx system update` updates OpenCodex itself. The separate Codex CLI inspection surface is:

```bash
ocx system codex-cli-update check --json
```

`check` makes no package-registry request and inspects bounded configured-candidate provenance evidence,
including a redacted executable location and ownership evidence. Trusted published-launcher context authenticates
the candidate snapshot, not successful Codex execution. Because this one-shot command never executes Codex,
environment and persisted candidates remain report-only (`managed: false`, normally `selection_unattested`);
`selectionAttested` remains `false`. The JSON report exposes `candidateAvailable`, `candidateVersion`, `candidateSource`,
and `selectionAttested`. Inspecting the configured candidate requires a trusted published-launcher context;
a direct Bun/source launch has no such proof, ignores ambient and persisted candidate state, and may report
`candidate_unavailable` on POSIX. On Windows this first slice performs no candidate or configuration filesystem I/O:
only a proof-captured absolute environment candidate can receive lexical app-bundle or version-manager labels;
every other Windows candidate fails closed. Because that slice never consults persisted state, a Windows run
with no captured environment candidate reports `windows_inspection_deferred` rather than `candidate_unavailable`:
the command cannot observe whether a Codex CLI is installed, so it reports the deferral instead of asserting
that no candidate exists. The command does not execute Codex or a package manager, repair a shim,
write configuration or cache state, stop a process, or install anything. App-bundled, recognized
version-manager, unverified standalone, and ambiguous shim states are reported as unmanaged or unknown
and are never classified as managed.

On Windows, a captured bare command such as `CODEX_CLI_PATH=codex`, a remote path, or a device path reports `candidate_path_unavailable` instead. Those cases have a captured candidate; its path is not eligible for this inspection.

#### Explicit installation observation on Windows x64

```text
ocx system codex-cli-update attest [--json]
ocx system codex-cli-update attest --candidate <absolute-path> --npm-prefix <absolute-path> --npm-cli <absolute-path> --node <absolute-path> [--json]
```

`attest` is an opt-in, read-only observation of a Windows x64 npm installation. With no options it identifies the selected candidate from the proof-bound launcher snapshot — the configured `CODEX_CLI_PATH` or the first `codex` on the captured PATH, with an OpenCodex wrapper resolving to its renamed `codex.opencodex-real.cmd` npm backing. Supplying all four absolute paths overrides discovery; discovery only proposes paths and the held-handle observation remains the authority. `--candidate` must name the standard npm `<prefix>/codex.cmd` or `<prefix>/node_modules/@openai/codex/bin/codex.js`. `--npm-cli` must end in `node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js`; `--node` names an explicit `node.exe`. App bundles, recognized version-manager layouts, opencodex-owned shims without their npm backing, and custom wrappers are refused.

Native handles hold the ancestor directories and files during bounded reads. Unsupported platforms, reparse points/junctions, conflicting writers, unsafe paths, and oversized files are refused. The fixed report contains no paths: `status` is `observed` or `refused`, with `installationIdentityObserved`; `selectionAttested`, `managed`, and `applyAllowed` remain `false`. Check `status`, not just the process exit code: a reported refusal can exit 0.

An observed identity or digest describes those files during this observation. It is not a durable update permit and does not prove the selected runtime, the past installer, effective npm configuration, or tool authenticity. The supplied Node is observed only, not proven to be the Node a launcher would select. No target is executed; no registry request, installation, configuration write, or process control occurs. The existing Windows `check` command still performs no candidate/configuration filesystem I/O.

### `ocx config <show|get|set|unset|validate|export|import> ...`

Inspect and safely modify validated OpenCodex configuration. `show` and `get` mask secrets. Import
validates before writing and requires `--yes`.

Display and mutation output strip credentials from proxy URLs while retaining the host and port.
`direct` and credential-free proxy values stay readable. `export` preserves credentials so the
backup can restore the configuration; store exported files as secrets.

### Usage from a connected client

`ocx usage` reads the connected hub with this client's enrolled data key. Human output identifies the hub source and client-key scope; `--json` returns the same scoped data. Range, surface, provider/model filters and custom `--since`/`--until` bounds remain available. Account breakdowns and other clients' records are not shared. An old or unavailable hub produces an explicit error instead of substituting local usage; upgrade the hub if it does not support this read.

The read-only data-plane endpoint is `GET /v1/usage`, using `x-opencodex-api-key` with a configured client key. Environment-wide and admin keys are refused. It accepts `range`, `surface`, `provider`, `model`, `since`, and `until`; unknown/repeated options and caller-selected key IDs are rejected. Oversized skipped rows retain the explicit incomplete-history warning.
