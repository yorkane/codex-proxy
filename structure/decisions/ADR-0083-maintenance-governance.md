# ADR-0083 — decision recorded under "Maintenance governance"

- Contract owner: [ops/docs-and-release.md](../ops/docs-and-release.md#maintenance-governance)

## Decision record

- 목적과 의도: Make project ownership and review authority discoverable without exposing credentials or treating a documentation file as an access-control mechanism.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: Contribution and security docs referred to maintainers generically, while the repository had no maintainer roster or CODEOWNERS policy. GitHub permissions can change independently of the source tree.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Keep the roster only in GitHub settings; introduce a larger standalone governance charter; list raw GitHub permission levels in the repository.
- 선택한 방식: Add a concise maintainer roster and merge policy, use CODEOWNERS for review routing, and keep actual permission state authoritative in GitHub settings.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: A two-maintainer project needs clear ownership and sensitive-path review rules but does not yet need a separate governance framework.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Contributors can identify reviewers and merge expectations directly from the repository. The roster must be updated when responsibilities change, and CODEOWNERS still requires branch-protection configuration to enforce approvals.
