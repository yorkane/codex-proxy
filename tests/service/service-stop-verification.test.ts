/**
 * #764: `ocx service stop` reported success while the proxy kept running, and native Codex was
 * restored on top of it.
 *
 * The subtlety is which failure mode matters. PR #780 waited only when `schtasks /end` returned
 * an ERROR -- but the reported case is an /end that SUCCEEDS while the wrapper survives and
 * respawns its child a few seconds later. On that path the stop command has nothing to report,
 * so the outcome has to be probed rather than inferred from the command's exit status.
