# CL-10 Final Review Closure

This addendum records the runtime contracts added after the final deep review of PR #1510. It supplements the earlier CL-10 hardening plan and does not expand scope into CL-10.5 remote publishing.

## Community mutation contention

Public-evidence mutation remains serialized across processes, but a live non-reclaimable owner is now a fail-fast condition. Synchronous callers receive `PublicEvidenceValidationError` with code `community_cache_busy` instead of blocking the JavaScript agent while polling.

The management API maps `community_cache_busy` to HTTP `503` and sets `Retry-After: 1`. Other public-evidence validation failures remain client errors. Stale-owner recovery, inode checks, exclusive reclaim claims, and ownership-safe release semantics are unchanged.

## Sensitive purge semantics

Once durable local provenance classifies a community cache pathname as locally originated, sensitive purge removes that exact pathname even if the cached object has become oversized, hardlinked, symlinked, or otherwise unreadable through normal community-object validation.

Deletion uses pathname unlink semantics only. It does not follow a symlink target and does not remove another hardlink to the same inode. `ENOENT` is treated as already absent; other unlink failures remain errors. Origin markers are cleared only after the community deletion pass and directory durability boundary complete.

## Revocation target errors

A direct same-publisher bundle revocation whose target bundle is absent is normalized to `PublicEvidenceValidationError` code `revocation_target` with message `revocation target bundle not found`. The optimized direct-target path must not leak platform-specific filesystem `ENOENT` errors.

## Regression requirements

The closure is protected by focused tests that require:

- live lock contention to throw `community_cache_busy` synchronously without running protected work;
- one signal-zero owner-liveness check on that refusal, rejecting repeated live-owner polling;
- the management community endpoint to return `503` plus `Retry-After: 1` for that contention;
- both rejection paths to preserve the existing owner bytes and lock directory identity;
- oversized locally-originated community copies to be removed during sensitive purge;
- hardlinked locally-originated cache pathnames to be removed while a peer hardlink survives; and
- missing direct revocation bundle targets to return stable `revocation_target` errors.

The contention tests originally required completion in under 500 ms. That wall-clock criterion
included filesystem and management-route work and could fail under shared CI load before checking
the actual response contract. Verification now checks synchronous refusal, one owner-liveness probe,
and ownership preservation under the normal test deadline. The probe count detects repeated owner
checks, but does not promise to detect an unrelated one-off delay. This changes the test oracle, not the fail-fast/no-polling runtime
contract above, and does not establish a new response-time SLA.

Exact-head GitHub Actions success is required before this closure is considered verified. PR #1510 must remain open and unmerged during this review cycle.
