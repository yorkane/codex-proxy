/**
 * Durable token spend reservation, above the send-count workflow guard (#4546).
 *
 * The count cap treats a 1k-token send and a 150k-token send as the same unit, and the
 * in-memory ledger forgets everything on restart: an exhausted root came back with a fresh
 * allowance after every relaunch, and a second process never saw the first one's spend at
 * all. This ledger reserves TOKENS before dispatch and rebuilds its state from a journal
 * under the opencodex home directory, so an exhausted scope is still exhausted after a
 * restart.
 *
 * A reservation is always the request's whole input plus its ENFORCEABLE output ceiling --
 * the caller's max_output_tokens, or the model's documented cap when the caller sent none.
 * Never an optimistic estimate, and never shrunk by a cache-hit expectation: a prefix that
 * misses is billed in full, so the safety figure reserves as if it misses. Cache
 * expectations may inform efficiency reporting; they do not move this number.
 *
 * Admission requires, at every scope that applies at once -- root workflow, authenticated
 * identity, and account pool:
 *
 *   settled spend + in-flight reservations + unresolved spend + this reservation <= limit
 *
 * Unresolved spend is the conservative residue of a send whose usage frame was lost: the
 * tokens may have been billed, so the reservation is moved to unresolved rather than
 * released. Minting a new root id mints no new budget because the identity and pool scopes
 * still hold the spend.
 *
 * SUPPORTED TOPOLOGY: this guarantees a single proxy process against its own journal. The
 * file is append-friendly, but nothing here serializes two live processes writing it, so a
 * second proxy sharing the same OPENCODEX_HOME is explicitly outside the guarantee -- that
 * needs a shared store with cross-process atomicity and is declared out of scope rather
 * than implied.
 *
 * Five properties this file owes its callers. Each one was absent in the first draft, and a
 * budget that can be bypassed is worse than no budget because it looks like protection:
 *
 * 1. IDENTITY OF A SEND. A send id is either KNOWN -- and then reserving it again is refused
 *    rather than waved through booking nothing -- or FULLY forgotten, and then it books a
 *    fresh reservation. There is no third state where the ledger recognises an id and
 *    charges nothing for it, which is what let one id authorise unlimited physical sends.
 * 2. DURABILITY BEFORE ADMISSION. Under a configured limit the reserve record must be on
 *    disk before the request is admitted. Failing open on a disk-full or permission error
 *    forgets the request across a restart, which is the exact case durability exists for.
 *    Observe-only mode still admits, and says so through `durable: false`.
 * 3. REPLAY VALIDATES. Every journal record is checked field by field before it moves a
 *    counter. A corrupt record in the MIDDLE of the file would silently undercount, so it
 *    fails accounting closed instead; only an unparseable FINAL line -- a torn tail write --
 *    is dropped quietly.
 * 4. BOUNDED RETENTION. Cleanup runs automatically, writes durable tombstones so replay
 *    cannot resurrect what it removed, and compacts the journal to a checkpoint. When
 *    nothing can be evicted safely, admission is refused rather than made room for by
 *    forgetting an exhausted scope -- forgetting one is the laundering this layer prevents.
 * 5. NOTHING IDENTIFYING ON DISK. Root ids come from a client header and identity ids are
 *    credential ids, so the journal stores salted aliases only, under owner-only permissions
 *    that are re-applied to an EXISTING file rather than trusted from its creation.
