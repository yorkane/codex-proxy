title: Factory Droid bridge
description: Connect Factory Droid models to opencodex through a local Responses-compatible bridge.
---

Factory Droid is an agent runtime, not a documented OpenAI-compatible inference endpoint. If a
custom provider pointed at an internal Factory LLM URL returns `403 Forbidden`, changing only the
opencodex adapter or adding provider headers does not make that private route a supported public API.

The working integration is:

```text
Text-only Responses client
  -> opencodex (http://127.0.0.1:10100/v1/responses)
  -> local Responses bridge (http://127.0.0.1:11435/v1/responses)
  -> official droid exec command
  -> Factory account and selected model
```

This keeps the Factory credential inside the official Droid client. OpenCodex receives a separate,
local-only bridge token.

## What failed and why

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `403 Forbidden` from a Factory LLM URL | The URL is not a documented general-purpose OpenAI endpoint for third-party clients | Invoke Factory through the official Droid CLI or SDK |
| `404` at `/models/models` | The provider base URL already ended in `/models` | Use an API root as `baseUrl`; never include the discovery path |
| Model search fails | The bridge does not expose a complete live catalog | Set `liveModels: false` and provide a static `models` list |
| Loopback provider is rejected | Private-network access is denied by default | Set `allowPrivateNetwork: true` only for the loopback bridge |
| `${DROID_BRIDGE_TOKEN}` is unresolved | The variable is missing from the opencodex service environment | Inject it into the service process, not only an interactive shell |
| `OutputTextDelta without active item` | The bridge emitted a text delta before opening an output item and content part | Emit the complete Responses SSE lifecycle in order |

The same Factory credential can therefore work in `droid exec` while a direct request to an
undocumented LLM URL still returns `403`. Those results test different products and should not be
treated as contradictory.

## Prerequisites

1. Install and sign in to the [Droid CLI](https://docs.factory.ai/droid-cli/quickstart).
2. Confirm a bounded headless request works:

   ```bash
   droid exec --model glm-5.2 --output-format json "Reply with DROID_OK only."
   ```

3. Run a local bridge that invokes `droid exec` (or the official Droid SDK) and exposes:

   - `GET /healthz`
   - `GET /v1/models`
   - `POST /v1/responses`

Factory documents `droid exec` as its non-interactive automation surface and recommends JSON output
for scripts. For a longer-lived integration, Factory also documents stream JSON-RPC and official
TypeScript and Python SDKs in the
[Droid Exec guide](https://docs.factory.ai/droid-exec/overview).

## Bridge contract

Bind the bridge to `127.0.0.1`, require a randomly generated bearer token, cap request sizes, and
allowlist model IDs. The minimal bridge accepts only these Responses `input` shapes:

- a non-empty string; or
- an array containing only `message` items. Each message must have a `user`, `developer`, `system`,
  or `assistant` role and either string content or text-only content parts (`input_text` for input
  roles and `output_text` for assistant history).

Validate the complete request before invoking Droid. If an input part is an image or file, `tools`
contains any tool definition, or `input` contains a tool call or result (`function_call`,
`function_call_output`, `custom_tool_call`, or `custom_tool_call_output`), return HTTP `400` with a
Responses-style `invalid_request_error`. Use a stable bridge-specific code such as
`unsupported_bridge_input` and identify the rejected field in the message. Do this before starting
SSE, even when `stream: true`; never discard, stringify, or flatten unsupported content into the
prompt.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "unsupported_bridge_input",
    "param": "tools",
    "message": "The minimal Droid bridge does not accept tool definitions."
  }
}
```

For an accepted request, the bridge should:

1. Convert the accepted Responses `input` to a prompt.
2. invoke `droid exec --model <id> --output-format json <prompt>`;
3. parse the final `result` and `session_id`;
4. return an OpenAI Responses envelope; and
5. map `previous_response_id` to the Droid session ID when continuation is required.

For streaming responses, emit this lifecycle in order:

```text
response.created
response.output_item.added
response.content_part.added
response.output_text.delta
response.output_text.done
response.content_part.done
response.output_item.done
response.completed
```

Do not expose the bridge on `0.0.0.0` and do not reuse the Factory credential as the bridge bearer
token.

## OpenCodex provider configuration

Create the custom provider with the explicit provider ID `droid`:

```bash
ocx provider add droid \
  --adapter openai-responses \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:11435/v1 \
  --default-model glm-5.2 \
  --allow-private-network
```

This creates the `providers.droid` config entry. In the dashboard, open **Providers → droid → Edit
JSON** and replace that provider's value with:

```json
{
  "adapter": "openai-responses",
  "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:11435/v1",
  "responsesPath": "/responses",
  "allowPrivateNetwork": true,
  "authMode": "key",
  "apiKey": "${DROID_BRIDGE_TOKEN}",
  "liveModels": false,
  "models": ["glm-5.2", "glm-5.2-fast", "kimi-k3"],
  "defaultModel": "glm-5.2"
}
```

The model IDs are examples. Keep only models that `droid exec` can use for the signed-in Factory
account. Do not add Factory-specific inference headers to this provider: its upstream is the local
bridge, not a Factory HTTP endpoint.

After saving a provider or changing its static catalog, synchronize and restart Codex so new
sessions read the updated catalog:

```bash
ocx sync --restart-codex
ocx doctor
```

`--restart-codex` restarts matching app-servers and fully quits and relaunches the Codex desktop
app, which ends live conversations. Use `--restart-app-server-only` to leave the desktop app
running. Run the restart only after finishing or saving those sessions.

## Verify the complete route

Check each boundary separately:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:11435/healthz
ocx doctor
ocx access test droid/glm-5.2 --protocol responses
```

A provider row or model-picker entry proves only catalog visibility. The integration is working only
after the Responses probe returns through the `droid/<model>` route.

## Current limitation

The minimal bridge above translates text and the Responses SSE lifecycle. It does **not** implement
the full bidirectional Codex function/tool-call protocol. Codex App and `codex exec` normally send
tool definitions even when a prompt says not to call tools, and the current Codex CLI has no general
flag that removes those definitions. The minimal bridge must reject those requests with the `400`
contract above. Tool definitions, tool calls, tool results, permissions, cancellation, and rich
Droid events require a stateful bridge built on Factory's stream JSON-RPC mode or an official Droid
SDK. Treat `ocx access test` success as text-path verification, not Codex agent or tool-path
verification.
