# 030 — Windows baseline: what the failures actually were

Work-phase `wp3`. Criterion `c-5`. Evidence, not a landed fix.

A full Windows suite was already running on `desktop-c795oh4` when this unit
started (`/c/ocxwin/repo` at `00834d710`, shards `base-1..4`). It was read-only
evidence for this unit and was not disturbed. A second run on Bun `1.4.0`
followed (`v140-1..4`).

## The headline

| run | Bun | fail |
|---|---|---:|
| `base-1..4` | 1.3.14 | 179 |
| `v140-1..4` | 1.4.0 | 25 |

Shard 1 alone went from 100 `(fail)` lines to 2. **The Windows suite was not
telling us about 179 product defects; it was mostly reporting one harness
failure over and over.**

## Why 161 of them were one bug

`tests/preload.ts` calls `acquireTestRunLock` (line 42) BEFORE it arms the guard
with `OCX_TEST_HOME_GUARD=1` (line 64). On Windows the lock path needs the
effective account SID, and under 4-shard load that lookup timed out:

```text
CodexUserIdentityRefusal: Windows effective-account lookup timed out.
  at powershellValue (src/codex/user-identity.ts:252)
  at resolveWindowsSid (src/codex/user-identity.ts:261)
  at resolveDefaultTestRunLockPath (scripts/test-run-lock.ts:227)
  at tests/preload.ts:42
```

The worker then ran with the guard permanently off, and every test that asserts
"this helper is only available under the repository test preload" failed as a
cascade: 44 in `codex-reset-credit-operation-ledger`, 68 in
`codex-reset-credit-recovery`, 49 in `lab-fabric-task`.

**That cascade had teeth.** With the guard down, two suites reached live
machine state instead of being refused:

- `windows-elevation-spawn.test.ts:89` expected `launcherPid: null` and got
  `18144` — a real PowerShell process was launched.
- `service.test.ts:1283`/`:1307` expected "refusing to mutate the
  machine-global Windows Task Scheduler from an armed test process" and instead
  got real scheduler-registration outcomes.

So the ordering in `preload.ts` is not only noisy, it is the difference between
a refused test and one that touches the developer's own Task Scheduler. Worth
fixing on its own merits, independently of the Bun version that exposed it.

## What survives on Bun 1.4.0

25 failures in three groups:

- `multi-account auth store` — 22 of the 25, one file. Not yet diagnosed.
- `ocx v2 keep-native-v1` — 2. Dirac classified the `base` occurrence as a test
  artifact: the product CLI exited 0 and the V2 disable took effect; only the
  spy compares raw argv, and Windows `.cmd` invocation goes through the ComSpec
  wrapper (`src/lib/win-exec.ts:79`), which is correct behaviour.
- `cli wiring > interactiveGuardOk ... when cwd is unlinked` — 1.

## Not fixed here, and why

This unit's authority is the admin-token UX. None of the surviving failures are
in that surface, and each needs its own reproduction on Windows before a fix is
more than a guess — the `base` run's evidence is contaminated by the guard
cascade, so a fix written against it would be written against an artifact.

The honest carry-forward was three separate units. The first is now closed.

1. ~~Arm `OCX_TEST_HOME_GUARD` before `acquireTestRunLock`~~ — **done** in PR
   [#3507](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/3507), merged `663fdbb0a`.
   The preload now runs sandbox → arm + assert → lock. Two regressions guard it:
   a source-order assertion (nothing else can see this — with a lock that happens
   to succeed the runtime state is identical either way) and a probe proving an
   armed process with a real `HOME` and no lock still refuses the protected home.
   Stashing the reorder was verified to turn the first one red. The order was
   re-confirmed on `desktop-c795oh4` itself, read-only, without contending with
   the suite running there: `sandbox 1414, arm 2969, assert 3228, lock 4168`.
2. Diagnose `multi-account auth store` on Windows — 22 of the surviving 25.
3. Decide whether `keep-native-v1` should assert on parsed argv rather than the
   raw ComSpec string.

Issue #3320 (non-ASCII account names misclassifying a valid scheduler task) is
adjacent to (1) — both are Windows identity handling — but it is `needs-info`
and was not reproduced here, so it stays open.

## Why the guard fix was worth doing on its own

It is tempting to read "161 of 179 failures" as a noise-reduction win and stop
there. The number is the least interesting part.

Those 161 were the *visible* consequence. The invisible one is that
`src/lib/windows-elevation.ts` and `src/service.ts` refuse live elevation and
machine-global Task Scheduler mutation ONLY while the guard is armed. A worker
that lost the guard did not merely fail loudly — it silently gained the ability
to do the things those refusals exist to prevent, and two suites took it:
a real PowerShell process at pid 18144, and real scheduler registration.

So the failure mode was inverted from how it looked. The 161 red tests were the
alarm, not the damage; the damage was in the handful that went green by doing
something to the developer's machine. A run that had been slightly luckier with
its SID lookup would have shown fewer failures and done the same writes.

That is also why the regression asserts source ORDER rather than runtime state.
When the lock succeeds — which is almost always — an armed-after-lock preload
and an armed-before-lock preload produce byte-identical environments. There is
no runtime observation that separates them except on the exact runs where it
already went wrong.
