/**
 * Where a process running ON THE HUB ITSELF dials the hub (#4236).
 *
 * There are TWO destinations here, not one base URL substituted everywhere, and conflating
 * them is what broke every local integration on a tailnet-bound hub:
 *
 * 1. `localManagementOrigin` — authenticated management discovery/state (`/api/*`). It is
 *    served by the public listener and, on a hub, additionally by the loopback-only
 *    `hub.managementIngress`. Callers must still send a management credential: management
 *    authentication has no loopback bypass (structure/05), and the unauthenticated loopback
 *    listener deliberately does not serve `/api/*` at all.
 * 2. `localInferenceDestination` — the data plane a client wire actually speaks.
 *
 * Both resolvers have the SAME three-branch shape, because the bind address is the thing that
 * decides. The first review of this module got that wrong for inference: it returned
 * `http://127.0.0.1:<public port>` unconditionally whenever the loopback listener was off, so a
 * hub with `hostname: <tailnet IP>` and no listener handed all eight call sites a socket that
 * does not exist. The bind address has to be the fallback, exactly as it already was for
 * management:
 *
 *   loopback listener enabled   → `127.0.0.1:<effective listener port>`, no credential
 *   loopback/absent `hostname`  → `127.0.0.1:<public port>`, no credential
 *   wildcard `hostname`         → `127.0.0.1:<public port>`, ADMISSION CREDENTIAL REQUIRED
 *   anything else               → `<probeHostname(hostname)>:<public port>`, credential REQUIRED
 *
 * A wildcard bind does answer on 127.0.0.1, which is why its origin stays loopback, but the
 * public listener demands data-plane admission regardless of which address received the
 * request — so it lands in the same credential bucket as a tailnet bind. That is why the
 * resolver returns a STRUCT rather than a string: a caller that cannot see
 * `requiresAdmissionToken` cannot tell a free socket from one that will 401, and the only
 * honest answers are "attach the data-plane credential" or "say so in a log line".
 *
 * The credential in question is the DATA-PLANE one — `OPENCODEX_API_AUTH_TOKEN`, the hardened
 * service token file, or a configured `apiKeys` entry, the same ladder
 * `standaloneCodexRoutingTarget` / the Codex provider table already uses. Never the admin
 * token: no exported client configuration may carry management authority (reviewer constraint
 * on #4236).
