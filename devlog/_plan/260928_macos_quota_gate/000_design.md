# macOS signed-in desktop quota gate: design decision

Status: proposed; #6196 remains blocked on a supported desktop integration contract.
Date: 2026-09-28. This is a read-only source/evidence assessment, not a native-client result.
Baseline: `09f8e5ebfee1cf594181dfa8e29befa0bae7e06e` (`dev`).

## Decision log

- Purpose: allow the original desktop composer to submit an independently funded
  provider turn while retaining signed-in account features and honest quota display.
- Constraints: the reported macOS build obtains authoritative gate data through its
  bundled Rust app-server. Chromium PAC configuration does not own that transport.
  No supported desktop app-server replacement/selection contract was established.
- Alternatives: upstream provider-aware composer admission; a supported app-server
  adapter contract; a separate client. Compare these below.
- Choice: upstream provider-aware admission, with a narrowly scoped OpenCodex route
  admission contract if the app cannot classify and reserve the effective inference
  lane itself. Do not overload the existing account/provider capability booleans.
- Why: it separates account identity from inference entitlement without modifying
  signed app contents, moving account credentials, or misrepresenting account quota.
- Tradeoff: requires upstream desktop cooperation; an OpenCodex-only release cannot
  honestly promise this fix today. A companion client is not requirement-equivalent.

## Evidence and scope

1. [#6196](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/issues/6196) reports macOS 27 arm64,
   app 26.924.22138/build 11645 and OpenCodex 2.68.0. After approximately 20 hours,
   PAC intercept ports had no established connections while bundled app-server owned
   relevant connections. Logs attribute usage streaming and reqwest errors to it.
   These are reporter observations, not independently repeated measurements here.
2. [#5947](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/5947), reviewed head
   `eb6953b8c78497931147966791f9bf804f953398`, is open. Its launch routing is Chromium
   host-resolver/PAC configuration. `src/chatgpt/desktop-unblock/rewrite.ts:43-55`
   selects usage/conversation responses; lines 94-163 alter quota gate fields only
   after traffic arrives. Its body explicitly lacks live app validation. A successful
   curl CONNECT/TLS exercise establishes relay plumbing, not app transport coverage.
3. [#6079](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/pull/6079), reviewed head
   `4c6f745eb6dbc1dc9df95b2a5c34e75099655797`, is an open Windows-only draft. Its body
   separately documents Electron net.fetch attribution on Windows 26.924.2738.0 and
   the macOS limitation. `src/codex/desktop-compatibility/usage-policy.ts:26-48` controls two WHAM booleans, not the
   selected provider. Conversation initialization passes unchanged. Natural-exhaustion
   recovery is still unverified. `src/codex/desktop-compatibility/runtime-ownership.ts:15-27` binds exact PAC URL to
   a process-local runtime generation; this is useful lifecycle precedent, not a macOS fix.
4. Baseline `src/codex/desktop-app/darwin.ts:25-66,174-195,249-260` discovers the
   bundle by identifier/realpath, scopes processes to the current uid, and relaunches
   with `open -b`. It carries no app-server transport override. The measured topology
   in `devlog/_plan/260913_cross_platform_desktop_app_restart/001_platform_topology.md`
   places app-server at `Contents/Resources/codex`. Killing it alone can cause respawn.
5. `src/codex/shim-templates.ts:30-50,152-163` treats app-server as an internal command
   and execs the saved CLI launcher. It is not evidence of intercepting the separately
   bundled desktop executable. `src/codex/inject/config-toml.ts:32-44` also records
   desktop 26.924 rewriting model-provider config; a static config file is not proof
   of the running app's provider or authoritative quota-cache consumer.
6. [Official App Server auth documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/app-server#auth-endpoints)
   defines `account/rateLimits/read`, corresponding updates, and account state. It
   does not establish a desktop gate override or a supported bundled-server swap.
   [Configuration reference](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-reference)
   defines provider auth/base URL independently. That does not prove the signed-in
   desktop composer honors provider-specific quota admission. All contract names
   proposed below are design placeholders, not existing OpenAI APIs or CLI flags.
7. The current app-server protocol already exposes `account/read.requiresOpenaiAuth`,
   `Thread.modelProvider` through `thread/read`, and
   `modelProvider/capabilities/read`. Those are the closest supported primitives, but
   none binds a result to one request or to the final downstream credential/transport.
   When OpenCodex emits its injected provider-table form, the current emitter writes
   `requires_openai_auth = true` unless the explicit authless opt-in is effective
   (`src/codex/inject/config-toml.ts:167`; asserted by
   `tests/codex-integration/codex-inject.test.ts:106,143`). That evidence is about the
   `opencodex` provider's native sign-in requirement, not the funding source of a
   provider/model selected behind the proxy.
8. Current routing already shows why admission has to cover the complete execution
   path. `PolicyRequestEvidence` is a closed request-derived projection
   (`src/routing/evaluator.ts:40-48`), while Responses policy fallback retains an
   immutable initial trace but constructs and dispatches another physical request for
   a later candidate (`src/server/responses/policy-fallback.ts:26-72,178-205`). That is
   useful decision evidence, but it is not a reservation of final transport/auth
   funding or a generation fence for every physical attempt.

## Alternatives

| Option | Mechanism | Requirement fit / decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A: upstream provider-aware admission | Desktop/bundled app-server keep authentic quota reads; composer applies ChatGPT quota only to routes funded by that account | Recommended. No credential interception or bundle changes; needs upstream support |
| B: supported external app-server adapter | Only if upstream documents a desktop endpoint/executable hook, app explicitly selects an adapter exposing a separate route-admission capability | Conditional. Must retain native auth ownership and prove every gate consumer uses the contract; no hook established today |
| C: separate OpenCodex composer/client | A supported app-server client submits independent-provider turns outside the native composer | Implementable separately, but not a #6196 fix: native composer and feature parity are hard requirements |

Do not implement B by replacing bundle resources, patching ASAR, re-signing the app,
injecting dylibs, copying tokens, installing a CA, or redirecting ChatGPT base URLs.
`HTTPS_PROXY`/CONNECT without TLS termination can change routing but cannot change
encrypted gate data. PAC/host-resolver switches do not establish Rust transport
coverage. An older app version is neither an architectural fix nor a supported rollback plan.

## Recommended architecture and ownership

Keep two planes independent:

- Account plane: native signed app -> bundled app-server -> OpenAI account services.
  OAuth, usage JSON/stream, plugins, marketplace and sync stay native. Do not rewrite
  quota or infer unlimited capacity from a missing account response.
- Inference plane: selected thread/model -> resolved execution route -> OpenCodex
  provider request. Desktop admission uses the effective route, not a model name,
  UI selection alone, global provider setting, or account-wide boolean.

Proposed upstream contract: a provider-aware admission result scoped to thread,
model, route revision and expiry. Return `independent`, `chatgpt`, `mixed`, or
`unknown`, plus a structured reason. This is funding scope, not an assurance that a
turn succeeds. Preserve all non-quota policy, auth, workspace and spend restrictions.

### Supported primitive decision

Use a separate request-scoped route-admission contract. Keep the three existing
primitives at their present scopes:

- `account/read.requiresOpenaiAuth` answers whether the active configured provider
  needs OpenAI account auth. It is not a turn entitlement.
- `Thread.modelProvider` is the persisted provider identity. One `opencodex` thread
  can reach several downstream providers through policy, combo and fallback routing.
- `modelProvider/capabilities/read` describes provider-wide capabilities. A single
  boolean there cannot describe one target in a multiplexed downstream graph.

Setting `requires_openai_auth = false` is therefore not the solution. It removes the
native login gate for the whole `opencodex` provider, including a target or fallback
that is ultimately funded by ChatGPT, and it conflicts with the requirement to retain
signed-in account features. Extending one of these provider-wide responses with another
boolean has the same ambiguity and invites caching outside the lifetime of a route.
A future upstream protocol revision may share types or discovery with the new contract,
but must retain a distinct request/response and freshness boundary.

The opt-in route-admission module stays outside the core hot path until negotiated. It
returns a bounded, short-lived route reservation with opaque request/thread binding,
the normalized selector and request-evidence digest, an immutable allowed-target plan,
config/policy/provider/account/runtime generations, funding scope and expiry. Never
return ChatGPT credentials, account ids, raw account-service responses or prompt text.
The existing native account, quota and provider-capability RPCs remain unchanged.

### Request binding and atomic route reservation

Build the reservation from the request that will actually be sent. Normalize
`PolicyRequestEvidence` using the same closed fields and defaults as dispatch
(`contextWindow`, tools, image input, structured output, reasoning effort, service
tier and encrypted-task requirement; see `src/routing/evaluator.ts:40-48`). Compute a
domain-separated HMAC over that projection, the normalized model selector,
thread/session binding and a canonical digest of the complete logical request. The
authenticated handshake establishes a short-lived binding secret unavailable to
admission-contract observers; neither request content nor an unkeyed reusable digest
crosses the contract. Only the keyed binding does. Both sides compare that binding
when the reservation is issued and consumed, so observing one admitted request cannot
authorize a different request without exposing prompt content.

Funding is classified only after resolving the final wire transport and auth source
for each concrete target. A ChatGPT bearer/account-service attempt is `chatgpt`; an
independent provider credential is `independent`; a target capable of selecting both
is `mixed`; missing transport/auth evidence is `unknown`. Provider names, aliases,
catalog rows and `requiresOpenaiAuth` are not sufficient funding evidence. Dynamic
policy or combo routes are conservatively `mixed` or `unknown` whenever their eligible
retry graph crosses funding classes or contains an unresolved target.

Before this quota-bypass admission can classify a credential-bearing target as
`independent`, its final wire transport must provide authenticated TLS with certificate
and hostname validation. Plaintext transport, failed validation or an unavailable TLS
check makes the target `unknown`, and no credential may be attached before validation
succeeds. This restriction is deliberately scoped to bypass admission: it does not
silently rewrite the existing transport policy for requests that remain under native
admission.

For an `independent` decision, OpenCodex atomically reserves the exact ordered target
plan before the desktop is allowed to send. The reservation closes over each allowed
provider/model, resolved transport and opaque credential domain, plus the generations
above. Every initial attempt, retry, combo hop, policy fallback, recovery reroute and
subagent fallback must consume a member of that immutable closure and recheck all
generations immediately before dispatch. No later configuration or health change may
append a target. An implementation that cannot reserve the exact plan may instead
issue an immutable allowed-target closure with the same per-attempt generation fences;
it may not return `independent` from an unfenced preview. Every member of either form
must itself have a final `independent` funding classification. A `chatgpt`, `mixed` or
`unknown` member makes the entire reservation ineligible for independent admission,
even if another member of the closure is independently funded.

A 3xx response is terminal for admission: the reservation contract never fetches a
`Location` and never treats a redirect destination as admitted. If redirects are ever
supported, each resolved `Location` is a new immutable target that must pass the full
funding classification, closure, generation, TLS and credential-attachment checks
before dispatch.

`previewRouteModel()` remains inspection-only. Current source explicitly defines it
as capability inspection without combo selection state (`src/router.ts:987-990`), and
the count-tokens path relies on that property (`src/server/claude-messages.ts:1480-1493`).
It must not reserve quota, accounts, pacing, spend or fallback order, and its result
cannot mint or satisfy a send admission.

On send, the app-server validates the same lease and the proxy revalidates it before
dispatch. A route lease must constrain the actual fallback graph: an independently
funded turn cannot silently fall back to the exhausted signed-in ChatGPT lane.
Mixed or unresolved routes retain native admission until a supported exact route is
selected. A request-digest mismatch, target outside the closure, consumed reservation,
expiry or generation mismatch rejects before dispatch with a typed stale/mismatch
result. The native client preserves the unsent draft and obtains a fresh reservation;
it never silently changes the route. After any attempt may have reached an upstream,
staleness stops automatic fallback rather than risking a duplicate. Invalidated leases
are never used as a reason to falsify account state. This closes the model/config,
policy and retry check/send races.

The composer shows the authentic exhausted account gauge while allowing only the
eligible independent route. Selecting a native ChatGPT model immediately restores
the native quota restriction. No synthetic `account/rateLimits/updated` notification
is emitted. Conversation restrictions must have upstream typed quota provenance;
unknown `blocked_features` or `limits_progress` entries remain enforced.

## macOS lifecycle and local endpoint contract

- Ship no modifications inside the signed/notarized app bundle. Verify the actual
  installed bundle id, canonical path, build, signing identity and app-server
  parent/uid/start identity during eventual operator-approved macOS qualification.
  Existing bundle-id checks alone are not signing/notarization proof.
- A new capability must be positively negotiated by the native consumer. A second
  client connected to app-server cannot change the original desktop's quota cache
  merely by reading it. If upstream offers no suitable hook, report unsupported.
- Prefer app-owned inherited IPC for B. For any loopback capability endpoint, bind
  only loopback and require an authenticated launch/session capability with exact
  endpoint and fresh runtime generation. Port reachability, matching URL shape and
  a persisted connection file do not establish ownership. Reject foreign origins,
  unexpected hosts, stale generations and cross-user clients before parsing payloads.
  Do not put bearer capabilities in argv, URLs or logs. Same-user arbitrary-code
  resistance is not claimed by ordinary filesystem tokens.
- Start/stop/update/account switch revokes all route leases before releasing sockets.
  Bind session authorization to installed build and provider/config generation; a
  restarted process at the same port is a new owner. No automatic adoption by URL.
- Keep this opt-in and lazy. Baseline provider-only installs must start no new timer,
  listener or optional subsystem. Reuse composition-root activation/cleanup seams.
- Ordinary LaunchServices launch and app update must be tested separately from managed
  restart. Do not assume shell environment reaches GUI children. No auto-restart or
  forced stop during observation; require operator approval with an active GUI session.

## Failure behavior and rollback

- Unsupported app/build, unknown contract/schema, ownership failure or stale lease:
  native behavior; explicit unsupported/stale diagnostic, never reported recovered.
- Proxy unavailable: independent route is unavailable with draft retained. Do not
  silently send the same prompt through ChatGPT, duplicate a turn, or retry a write.
- Request digest, exact target or generation mismatch: reject before dispatch and
  retain the draft. If an upstream attempt may already have started, report unknown
  outcome and suppress automatic replan/fallback for that submission.
- Account logout/switch, config edit, model switch, sleep/wake or SSE reconnect:
  invalidate affected admission state and recompute; late events cannot revive it.
- Native quota changes remain visible and cannot overwrite independent-route state;
  independent-route state cannot enter the actual quota cache or account pool capacity.
- Rollback disables the capability and revokes leases, preserving native login,
  sessions, user config and original app bundle. Back up only explicitly changed
  owned settings with private permissions; restore by revision/ownership match,
  not whole-file replacement over newer user edits. No trust-store rollback is needed.

## Validation plan (not executed)

1. Pure contracts: normalized `PolicyRequestEvidence` and request digests; final
   transport/auth funding; known/unknown funding; mixed fallback graphs; route revision
   and expiry; model/thread/account switches; stale late events; unknown restrictions;
   no quota-cache mutation. Static config is never treated as consumer evidence.
2. Integration: supported consumer handshake, readiness before publication, exact
   endpoint/generation ownership, foreign/stale/replaced listener, stop/start at same
   port, crash/reconnect, bounded frames/timeouts and cancellation. Exercise every
   retry/fallback path against the immutable closure, including config/policy/account
   generation changes; prove stale rejection retains the draft and sends nothing.
   Prove `previewRouteModel()` performs no reservation. Assert off mode starts no
   optional resources and account/auth traffic remains native.
3. Actual macOS UAT on the reported build and each intended supported replacement:
   use only an explicitly authorized test account whose quota reset time or supported
   recovery procedure is recorded before the test. Identify bundle/signature/build and
   source process/socket, capture a sanitized consumer-side admission receipt, naturally
   exhaust that account, select a known independent provider in the original composer,
   send, and prove provider completion. A disposable HOME isolates local files, not an
   account's remote quota; it is never permission or recovery for quota exhaustion. Wait
   for the recorded reset or perform the approved recovery after UAT. CLI/curl success,
   open stream counts and synthetic exhausted snapshots are insufficient.
4. Negative UAT: native ChatGPT remains quota blocked; mixed fallback cannot consume
   that lane; auth/workspace/spend restrictions survive. Verify login, plugins,
   skills, marketplace, sync, attachments and IME remain functional separately.
5. Lifecycle UAT: managed restart, ordinary quit/open, sleep/wake, reboot, app update,
   proxy crash/stop, same-port replacement and rollback. Record source head, package
   hash, app/OS/architecture, permissions and actual-user identity for each result.

Future tests run only in disposable HOME/CODEX_HOME/OPENCODEX_HOME. No build, tests,
app launch, account request, quota exhaustion, runtime mutation or deployment was
performed for this document.

## Rollout and priorities

Phase 0: approve this design and obtain upstream contract ownership; observation
only, with no unsupported interception. Phase 1: implement/verify route admission
and native consumer together under a disabled-by-default flag. Phase 2: explicit
macOS operator UAT and complete lifecycle receipts. Phase 3: opt-in release only for
qualified build/contract pairs; unknown updates disable the capability until qualified.
Do not merge #5947 or #6079 as evidence that this macOS issue is solved.

- P0 design rejection: any approach requiring credential interception, bundle/signing
  circumvention, fabricated entitlement or bypass of non-quota account restrictions.
  This is a design boundary, not a claimed discovered vulnerability.
- P1: no supported native consumer hook; no provider-scoped authoritative gate;
  fallback/check-send races; unproven preservation of signed-in features; absence of
  actual exhausted-account original-composer UAT. These block a fix claim/release.
- P2: provider-wide auth/capability ambiguity, unbound request evidence, unfenced
  retries/fallbacks or inspection-only previews treated as reservations; stale runtime
  ownership, restart/update drift, stream/cache ordering, incomplete permissions/rollback
  evidence and diagnostics confusing plumbing with recovery. These are required
  acceptance criteria, not reasons to widen interception.
