# Images Data Plane

Native result continuations and function-result injection follow [the mode-specific result and control contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#experimental-native-function-result-injection); this surface does not infer upstream support or alter its defaults.

Native steering follows [the shared WebSocket contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#experimental-native-mid-turn-steering); this surface's defaults remain unchanged.

Vision preprocessing and image/video/search execution use the Responses
[core module ownership](../transports/responses.md#core-module-ownership). This surface retains its existing behavior.

The configuration-only [plaintext V2 contract](../subagents.md#plaintext-v2-agent-messages)
is scoped to canonical ChatGPT Responses forwarding; other source-area behavior described here is unchanged.

Hosted Responses image-tool eligibility uses the shared compatibility policy without a
Codex Spark exception; standalone Images retain the separate relay contract below. See
[Responses transport](../transports/responses.md#responses-httpsse).

Shared parsing and streaming follow the [request-copy](../transports/byte-accounting.md#request-copy-accounting) and [stream-buffer accounting](../transports/byte-accounting.md#stream-buffer-accounting) contracts. Response-attached WebSocket telemetry follows the [stage record identity contract](../transports/responses-wire-shapes.md#passthrough-sse-stream-shapes-314).

## Standalone Images

Codex's local `image_gen.imagegen` tool makes a second Images request after the model calls it:
`POST /v1/images/generations` for generation or `POST /v1/images/edits` for reference-image edits.
These are standalone Images API routes, not the hosted Responses `image_generation` tool.

The shared Responses path follows the [bounded multipart recovery contract](../subagents.md#multipart-encrypted-task-recovery); credential admission and retry policy remain unchanged.

`src/server/images.ts` uses the existing ChatGPT/OpenAI fallback unless `images.provider` explicitly
selects a custom API-key `openai-responses` provider. Explicit selection fails closed when the
provider is missing, disabled, registry-managed, incompatible, or lacks a usable key; it never
falls through to another paid upstream. The relay accepts bounded JSON generation and edit requests,
then forwards the decoded JSON without rewriting Codex's edit schema. Each paid Images POST receives
one upstream attempt; client cancellation aborts the upstream and pool-only failures update the
existing account-health state. Unknown Images subpaths still reach the JSON `/v1/*` 404 guard.

When the OpenAI credential path is unavailable or its authentication fails, `generations` (not
`edits`) may fall back to Google Antigravity if that provider is logged in. The fallback is
credential-driven: it exists so an image request reaches a real upstream answer rather than dying on a
local credential error, and it does not apply when the caller selected an explicit keyed custom
provider, because a configured pool owns its own authentication failure rather than hiding it behind
separately billed generation.

On non-loopback binds, data-plane authentication and origin policy cover both Images routes. An
explicit keyed Images provider accepts the proxy admission secret as either an OpenAI-style bearer
or `x-opencodex-api-key` because the provider key replaces caller authorization before fetch. The
ChatGPT forward path still requires the dedicated header so its upstream bearer remains distinct.
The keyed path never enters `handleResponses`, so `src/server/images.ts` repeats
`selectProactiveApiKeyTransport` inside the keyed branch and rebuilds Authorization from the
returned clone rather than the earlier snapshot.

A configured key's model and provider scope applies to whichever destination the request settles
on: the ChatGPT forward account, the keyed provider, the xAI Imagine bridge, or the Antigravity
fallback. It is evaluated against that destination rather than the selector in the body, because
the bridge and the fallback choose their own model, and a body that names no model cannot satisfy
a model list. A refusal is the same 403 the scope returns on the routed path, and a key with no
scope reaches every destination as before. Coverage lives in
`tests/server/api-key-scope-images.test.ts`.

The API-key `openai-responses` path also adapts Codex's private standalone image tool to the public
Responses tool surface. A complete `image_gen` namespace is lowered to safe
`image_gen__<inner-name>` function aliases even when no hosted image tool is present, because public
Responses runtimes may reserve the namespace itself and reject dotted function names. Native and
legacy dotted calls replayed in `body.input` are encoded to the same aliases. When any client
image-gen declaration is replaced by a usable `image_gen__<inner-name>` alias, the adapter also drops
hosted `image_generation` and deduplicates aliases in stable container order. Empty or malformed
namespaces do not remove the hosted fallback. Discovery and normalization span both top-level
`body.tools` and Codex Desktop Responses Lite `input[].type = "additional_tools"` containers.

For a model explicitly listed in `modelPreferHostedTools`, a non-forward Responses provider may opt
to remove colliding client `image_gen` declarations before this normalization and rewrite their
selectors to hosted `image_generation`, so a provider-reserved hosted tool takes precedence without
loosening a caller's tool-choice restriction. The opt-in is intentionally model-scoped: the default
alias path remains safest for ordinary public Responses endpoints.

For OpenAI API virtual `-pro` models, preference lookup checks the selected public ID first and
uses the resolved base wire-model ID as a fallback. `modelAdapters` resolves the public ID first and
the base ID second; the second pass selects the final adapter, and configuration validation mirrors
both steps.

Client-facing API-key responses perform the inverse mapping: JSON output and SSE function-call
items restore `{ namespace: "image_gen", name: "<inner-name>" }` so Codex can dispatch the local
extension. When item-id repair is also enabled, both transforms compose in one SSE parse/stringify
pass (`src/server/sse-payload-rewrite.ts`) rather than chaining separate JS pull wrappers.
Inspection and continuation-cache branches keep the raw upstream alias, allowing stored
replays to return upstream without leaking a client-only namespace shape. The image-gen layer itself
leaves malformed and empty image-gen namespaces untouched, but on a noncanonical route the general
namespace boundary above runs after it and lowers whatever remains, so no private group reaches the
wire. ChatGPT forward mode preserves the private namespace and hosted tool because that backend
understands their native semantics.

Per-model `modelReasoningSummaryDelivery` is a narrow compatibility layer for
`openai-responses` gateways whose summary capability is real but whose accepted delivery enum
differs from Codex. Presence advertises reasoning summaries in the routed catalog and rewrites only
an already-present `stream_options.reasoning_summary_delivery` at the adapter boundary. It never
injects summary generation into a request, and config validation rejects a delivery map that
conflicts with `modelSupportsReasoningSummaries: false` for the same model.

> Decision record: [ADR-0045](../decisions/ADR-0045-standalone-images.md)

Usage consumers preserve positive incomplete-history metadata as specified in [usage accounting](../dashboard-and-usage.md#usage-accounting); readable totals are not represented as a complete ledger. Upstream API-key usage follows the [physical-attempt account attribution contract](../dashboard-and-usage.md#upstream-key-account-attribution), independently of subscription quota observations.

Connected CLI usage follows the [client-scoped hub usage contract](../dashboard-and-usage.md#usage-accounting); local management and account data remain separate.

Remote Workspace uses a separate, explicitly enabled server surface with structural WebSocket callbacks and awaited per-server cleanup; [its contract](../remote-workspace.md) owns that integration.

Listener startup diagnostics follow [the runtime lifecycle contract](../runtime.md#lifecycle); malformed optional listener blocks follow [config loading](../config.md#config-surface).
Chat helper admission in `src/server/responses/core.ts` follows the
[deferred stored-main contract](../providers/openai-tiers.md): only a needed Direct OpenAI helper
claims stored main, after terminal vision, routed vision and search exclusions.

The management quota DTO keeps Combo editing aligned with scoped inference evidence;
see [Combo editor routing quota](../dashboard-and-usage.md#combo-editor-routing-quota).

Codex pool settings and their consumers follow the [reset-first ordering contract](../providers/openai-accounts.md#reset-first-account-ordering), including independent-quota fallback and preserved affinity.

Optional Codex transport-hint suppression is scoped to canonical Responses client output;
its defaults and exclusions are owned by [Responses transport](../transports/responses.md).

CCA image-capable requests do not acquire the text-summary includeThoughts opt-in. See [Google summary boundary](../providers/google.md).

Claude replay carries [Go conversation affinity](inbound-compat.md#claude-affinity-at-final-go-dispatch)
privately to final dispatch; preliminary route selection does not inject Go-only headers.

Native Chat applies qualifying effort ceilings independently of model pins; pin selection precedes the cap and only pins or cap rewrites enter wire mapping. The [catalog effort contract](../catalog.md#ultra-reasoning-level) records the V1/compaction exemptions and caller-preservation boundary.

Pool quota producers and account commands follow the [bounded raw-observation contract](../providers/openai-accounts.md#bounded-pool-quota-observations), separate from the latest display snapshot and capacity estimates.

Account quota surfaces use [safe probe diagnostics](../transports/inventory.md#account-quota-failure-diagnostics) separately from quota validity, credential health and routing authority.

Combo child requests normalize effort and thinking controls against the selected target while retaining reasoning summaries; strict unknown targets preserve caller controls. The [Responses transport owner](../transports/responses.md) documents this boundary, and native Chat removes effort only for an explicit empty declaration or no-reasoning model.

Live sideband admission and its bounded upstream handshake follow the [runtime contract](../runtime.md#live-sideband-handshake); the ordinary Responses WebSocket exchange remains separate.

The [explicit model-capability contract](../config.md#explicit-per-model-capability-declarations) preserves operator declarations through provider storage and catalog capture; it does not infer upstream capability or change this surface's routing behavior.

Provider-scoped approval reviewer settings are projected by the [catalog owner](../catalog.md#provider-scoped-approval-reviewer); this surface retains its existing routing, transport and account-selection behavior.

Shared response-log retention and native SSE inspection pacing follow the [bounded inspection contract](../transports/byte-accounting.md#response-log-inspection); other subsystem behavior remains unchanged.

Native steering retains fixed phase deadlines and reconciled replay output; see the [steering stability contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#steering-deadlines-and-replay-completeness).

Native steering generation overrides, explicit public-API eligibility and the consent-gated wire probe follow the [shared control contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#steering-settings-public-api-and-diagnostic-probe); this owner does not change routing or execute diagnostic tools.

Dashboard Fast-row persistence and client refresh follow the [Fast selector rows setting contract](../gui-and-management-api.md#fast-selector-rows-setting).

Image-bearing Codex history follows the selected model's existing compaction handling after a
[compaction routing override](../transports/responses-failover.md#compaction-routing-overrides).
