 *
 * Two boundaries are load-bearing and both were divergences in an earlier attempt at this rewrite:
 *
 * - Whitespace after `Output:` may precede the marker, so an INDENTED `<empty>` still classifies.
 *   Rejecting it would leave the wrapper unnormalized and the failure unexplained.
 * - Only whitespace may follow the marker, so a DUPLICATE `<empty>` still does not classify.
 *   Accepting it would erase a real payload as an empty failed wrapper — the damaging direction.
 *
 * Behaviour is otherwise identical to the regex; the CRLF separators above are the only
 * intentional change, verified against a 63-shape differential corpus.
