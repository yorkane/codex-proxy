/**
 * The pool-wide recovery limiter, wired to the dispatch that actually sends (#4701).
 *
 * The primitives in `src/routing/probe-lease.ts` were complete and unit-tested before this, and
 * bounded nothing: no file under `src/` imported the module, so every hit for
 * `resolveHeldAccountDispatch` was its own definition or a direct unit test. An implementation
 * nothing calls is indistinguishable from an absent one at runtime, which is the whole of the
 * issue. The first case therefore drives the public Responses handler and observes the shared
 * limiter's demand counter at the physical-send boundary.
 *
 * The defect that reached production lived at the end of both transient-hold branches of
 * `resolveCodexAccountForThreadDetailed`: when no sibling could take the request they returned
 * the HELD account as `selected`, and the caller sent it at an account already known to be
 * failing. Under a provider-wide 503 that is every bound request at once -- the amplification
 * the hold exists to prevent rather than cause.
