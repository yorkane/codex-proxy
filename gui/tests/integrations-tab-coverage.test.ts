/*
 * The gap this closes.
 *
 * tests/gui/integrations-invariants.test.ts compares five client lists, and the
 * per-page label maps are Record<FileIntegrationClientId, TKey> so the compiler
 * forces those. TABS and FILE_CLIENTS are neither: they are a plain array and a
 * plain Set, so a client added everywhere else still gets no tab and nothing
 * fails. Aside was the twelfth client to walk this path, and the first with a
 * test standing in it.
 *
 * The expectation is DERIVED rather than written out, so adding client thirteen
 * cannot leave a stale literal here that passes by accident.
