title: "Combos: failover and load balancing"
description: Route one virtual model to several providers for failover or weighted load balancing.
---

A **combo** is one virtual model that fronts an ordered list of real provider/model targets. Your
client requests `combo/<id>`; opencodex chooses a target, rewrites the request to that concrete
`provider/model`, and can try another target when the first one has a retryable failure.

This is useful when you want either:

- **Failover:** prefer one model, but keep backups ready.
- **Load balancing:** spread successful requests across models or providers in weighted batches.

Combos sit in front of normal provider routing. Read [Model Routing](/guides/model-routing/) first
if `provider/model` selectors are new to you.

## 60-second quickstart

This example creates `combo/main` with Anthropic first and OpenAI second. Both providers must
already exist and be enabled.

```bash
ocx combo set main --targets anthropic/claude-opus-4-8,openai/gpt-5.6-sol
```

The default strategy is failover, so a normal request goes to
`anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`. If that attempt has a retryable failure, opencodex can hop to
`openai/gpt-5.6-sol`.

Use the virtual model anywhere you would normally provide a model id:

```json
{
  "model": "combo/main",
  "input": "Explain why the sky looks blue."
}
```

Confirm the saved definition:

```bash
ocx combo show main
```

:::tip
Start with failover and equal weights. Switch to round-robin only when you intentionally want to
distribute traffic, and add weights only when equal distribution is not appropriate.
:::

## How combo names work

The combo id in `ocx combo set <id>` must start with a letter or number. It may then contain
letters, numbers, `.`, `_`, or `-`, up to 64 characters total. Its canonical model id is always
`combo/<id>`; for example, id `main` becomes `combo/main`.

The `combo/` namespace is reserved while combos are configured. A provider named `combo` cannot
occupy it, and a combo id cannot duplicate a configured provider name.

An optional alias gives the combo a different public model name. An alias:

- uses the same characters as an id;
- may be bare, such as `daily-fast`, or contain one `/`, such as `team/daily-fast`;
- cannot be `combo` or start with `combo/`;
- cannot duplicate another combo alias; and
- cannot normally be a bare native OpenAI-family name beginning with `gpt-`, `o1-`, `o3-`, `o4-`,
  or `codex-`. The explicit Desktop compatibility mode below is the only exception.

Even when an alias is set, the canonical `combo/<id>` form still resolves. Canonical lookup runs
before alias matching, so an alias cannot take over another combo's canonical id.

:::note
Aliases change the public name clients request; they do not change the combo's stored id or the
concrete provider/model selectors behind it.
:::

## Codex Desktop native-allowlist compatibility

Some Codex Desktop releases apply a remote native-only `available_models` allowlist after the
app-server has already loaded `model_catalog_json`. Normal routed ids such as
`Nova1/codex-gpt-5.6-sol` are then usable by the CLI but absent from the Desktop picker. This is the
upstream [Codex Desktop bug](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/19694) tracked by
[opencodex #241](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/issues/241).

When you control an equivalent routed target, a combo can explicitly take over one native slug:

```bash
ocx combo set nova-sol \
  --targets Nova1/codex/gpt-5.6-sol \
  --alias gpt-5.6-sol \
  --native-alias \
  --display-name 'Nova1 - codex-gpt-5.6-sol'
```

This mode is deliberately opt-in and requires both `--native-alias` and a non-empty display label.
The alias must be one of the native model ids supported by this opencodex release; a native-family
prefix alone is not accepted because removal must be able to restore authoritative metadata.
When the routed target's discovery response supplies only a model id, the compatibility row fills
missing context, modality, and reasoning metadata from the native id it replaces. Explicit target
limits still win, so this fallback never raises a context cap or overrides declared capabilities.
It changes exact routing precedence: requests for `gpt-5.6-sol` resolve to `combo/nova-sol` before
the canonical OpenAI native-family route. The catalog contains one bare row with the configured
display label, not duplicate native and combo rows. Only the bare `gpt-5.6-sol` slug is captured.
Account-qualified rows such as `main/gpt-5.6-sol` and provider-qualified rows such as
`openai-apikey/gpt-5.6-sol` remain distinct OpenAI routes; the provider-qualified API-key route
never falls through to the native alias.

Visibility keys stay unambiguous:

- `combo/nova-sol` hides the compatibility combo from discovery.
- The bare `gpt-5.6-sol` entry in `disabledModels` continues to mean the dormant native OpenAI row;
  it does not hide the combo that currently owns that public slug.
- While at least one native alias is configured, disabled bare native rows are omitted from the
  effective Codex catalog instead of retained as `visibility: "hide"`. This prevents Desktop's
  allowlist from resurrecting rows it should not show. The Models page still lists unshadowed native
  switches, and re-enabling one restores its preserved or current native metadata.

:::caution
A native alias intentionally takes over a first-party-looking model id. Use it only when the target
is operationally equivalent and label the picker row honestly. Removing the combo restores normal
native routing and catalog identity on the next sync.

## Choose a strategy

### Failover: ordered primary and backups

`failover` selects the first eligible target in configuration order. A target is eligible when its
provider exists, is enabled, is not cooling down, and can handle any special request constraint.
Weights and `stickyLimit` do not affect this strategy.

Given this order:

1. `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`
2. `openai/gpt-5.6-sol`
3. `google/gemini-3-pro`

each request starts with Anthropic. A retryable Anthropic failure moves that request to OpenAI; a
retryable OpenAI failure can move it to Google. A terminal error stops immediately instead of
trying the remaining targets.

### Round-robin: smooth weighted batches

`round-robin` uses smooth weighted round-robin. A larger target weight gives that target a larger
share over time without sending all of its share as one long block. `stickyLimit` controls how many
successful requests stay on the selected target before the next weighted selection.

Create a 2:1 combo with batches of two successful requests:

```bash
ocx combo set balanced \
  --targets anthropic/claude-opus-4-8:2,openai/gpt-5.6-sol:1 \
  --strategy round-robin \
  --sticky 2
```

Calling the targets **A** (weight 2) and **B** (weight 1), the first six weighted selections are
`A, B, A, A, B, A`. Because `stickyLimit` is 2, each selection stays active for two successful
requests:

| Successful request | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Target | A | A | B | B | A | A | A | A | B | B | A | A |

The long-run share is still 2:1. A retryable failure ends the current sticky batch, cools that
target, and selects another eligible target for the same request.

:::caution
Weights are relative, not percentages. Weights `2,1` and `200,100` express the same ratio. Prefer
small values that communicate intent.
:::

### Random: weighted draw per request

`random` draws one eligible target per request, with odds proportional to `weight`. Every request
is an independent draw, so traffic spreads across targets without the deterministic pattern or
stickiness of round-robin. `stickyLimit` does not affect this strategy.

### Least-used: favor the target with fewest successes

`least-used` routes each request to the eligible target with the fewest successful requests
recorded by this opencodex process. Counts start at zero on restart, and ties keep configuration
order. Weights and `stickyLimit` do not affect this strategy.

### Reset-window: follow the soonest quota reset

`reset-window` routes each request to the eligible target whose cached provider quota snapshot
shows the soonest upcoming window reset (five-hour, weekly, monthly, or custom). This spends the
provider that refreshes first. Targets without fresh quota data, and ties, keep configuration
order. Weights and `stickyLimit` do not affect this strategy.

## What happens when a target fails

Combo failures are divided into **hop** failures and **terminal** failures.

| Result | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP 401, 403, 404, 408, 429, or any 5xx | Cool the target and hop to the next eligible target. |
| HTTP 410 with an explicit model end-of-life, retired, deprecated, sunset, decommissioned, or no-longer-available signal | Cool that target and hop. Unrelated 410 responses remain terminal. |
| Classified authentication, subscription, quota, rate-limit, overload, or upstream-server error | Cool the target and hop, even when the status alone is not sufficient. |
| Client cancellation (499), `origin_rejected`, cyber-policy refusal, context overflow, or invalid request | Stop and return the error; another target would not make the request valid. |
| Any other unclassified error | Stop and return the error. |

A hopped target enters cooldown for 60 seconds by default. If the upstream response includes a
valid `Retry-After` value, opencodex uses it instead. Numeric seconds and HTTP-date values are
accepted, and every cooldown is capped at 10 minutes.

The current request never retries the same attempted target. Later requests skip it until its
cooldown expires. If no eligible target remains, the proxy returns HTTP 503 with
`error.code = "combo_unavailable"`.

:::note
Failover is intentionally bounded. It helps with target-specific availability, authentication,
quota, and overload failures; it does not hide caller errors or policy refusals.
:::

For streaming requests, the upstream HTTP status is not the final decision. OpenCodex buffers a
bounded pre-output prefix of the selected child's Responses SSE. If the stream reports a retryable
`response.failed` terminal before any text, reasoning, tool call, or other output event, the child
is recorded as failed and the combo may try its next eligible target. Once any output event begins,
the target is committed: a later stream failure is returned to the client and is never replayed on
another provider, which prevents duplicate text and tool execution. If the pre-output buffer reaches
its safety cap without a terminal or output boundary, OpenCodex also commits the current target
instead of growing memory without a bound.

## Default reasoning effort

`defaultEffort` supplies `reasoning.effort` only when all of these are true:

1. the combo has a non-null default;
2. the caller did not set an effort; and
3. the selected target's catalog advertises that exact effort.

If the request has no `reasoning` object, opencodex creates one. If `reasoning` exists without an
`effort` property, it preserves the other fields and adds the default. A caller-provided effort is
never overwritten.

When target capability is unknown or does not include the configured effort, opencodex omits the
default and leaves the target's own behavior unchanged. Supported values are `low`, `medium`,
`high`, `xhigh`, `max`, and `ultra`; omit the field or set it to `null` to leave effort entirely to
the caller and target.

### Mixed-capability groups (`reasoningEffortMode`)

The effort levels a combo advertises are the intersection of what its targets advertise. A target
that explicitly advertises **no** effort control takes part in that intersection, so a single
no-effort backup empties the effort picker for the whole combo — including for the targets that do
support tuning.

Set `reasoningEffortMode: "adaptive"` to exclude those empty ladders from the published
intersection instead. The picker then shows the levels the remaining targets share, and the
no-effort target stays eligible for routing. Targets whose ladder is simply *unknown* are treated
as wildcards in both modes.

```json
{
  "combos": {
    "mixed": {
      "targets": [
        { "provider": "openai-apikey", "model": "gpt-5.6-luna" },
        { "provider": "local", "model": "no-effort-model" }
      ],
      "reasoningEffortMode": "adaptive"
    }
  }
}
```

The default is `"strict"`, which keeps the original behavior. This setting changes published
catalog metadata only — it does not change target order, failover policy, or which effort a given
target receives at dispatch. In the dashboard it is the **Adaptive reasoning ladder** switch in a
combo's Capabilities section.

## Image / multimodal capability

By default a combo publishes the **intersection** of its targets' input modalities (image is
enabled only when every target advertises it). Set `imageInput: "disabled"` to force text-only
even when every target supports images — the catalog drops `image` from `inputModalities`, and
image-bearing requests are rejected with HTTP 400 before any target is called. `"auto"` (or
omitting the field) keeps the automatic intersection.

## Encrypted v2 sub-agent tasks

There is one important limitation for Codex v2 sub-agents ([issue #92](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/issues/92)).
A native parent can send a newly spawned worker's task only as ciphertext minted for the native
ChatGPT backend. An external provider cannot read that payload.

For such a request, a combo filters its eligible targets to canonical native ChatGPT routes,
including after a retryable failure. If the combo has no decrypt-capable target, opencodex stops
before dispatch and returns HTTP 400:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "unreadable_encrypted_agent_task"
  }
}
```

This protects the task from being sent to a provider that would receive no readable instructions.
Readable plaintext tasks use the normal combo strategy.

You have four recovery options:

1. Select a native ChatGPT model for the child.
2. Add a canonical native ChatGPT target to the combo.
3. Use the v1 surface for delegation across different providers.
4. If you control the caller, resend the task as plaintext v2 `agent_message` content.

See [Sub-agent Surface](/guides/sub-agent-surface/) for the v1/base/v2 modes and the full encrypted
task workflow.

## Manage combos

### Dashboard

Open the local dashboard and choose **Models → Combos**. The workspace creates, edits, renames, and removes
combos, and its target picker excludes disabled models and nested combos.

Each target also shows a live quota badge: **Available**, **Out of quota**, or **Quota unknown**. Save and
Create are disabled only when every enabled target has fresh, complete evidence that its quota is exhausted.
Missing, stale, malformed, or incomplete aggregate evidence stays unknown and never locks a control. Polling
continues while the workspace is visible, so recovery automatically restores the action.

### CLI

The primary commands are:

```bash
ocx combo list
ocx combo show <id>
ocx combo set <id> --targets provider/model[:weight],...
ocx combo remove <id> --yes
```

`set` also accepts `--strategy`, `--sticky`, `--effort`, `--alias`, `--native-alias`,
`--display-name`, and `--rename-from`. Use `-` as the value of `--effort`, `--alias`, or
`--display-name` to clear that field. `--native-alias` requires a currently supported bare native
model alias and a non-empty display name. `create` and `update` are aliases for `set`; `delete` is an alias for
`remove`; and the same subcommands are available under `ocx route combo`.

### Management API

Headless clients use `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` on `/api/combos`. `GET` lists normalized combo
definitions, `PUT` creates or replaces one (and can rename one), and `DELETE` takes the id query
parameter. Authentication and request/response details are in the
[Management API reference](/reference/management-api/).

For the complete persisted configuration, see [Configuration](/reference/configuration/).

## Configuration reference

Combos are stored in the top-level `combos` object, keyed by combo id:

```json
{
  "combos": {
    "balanced": {
      "targets": [
        { "provider": "anthropic", "model": "claude-opus-4-8", "weight": 2 },
        { "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5.6-sol", "weight": 1 }
      ],
      "strategy": "round-robin",
      "stickyLimit": 2,
      "defaultEffort": "high",
      "alias": "team/balanced"
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Default | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `targets` | Yes | — | Non-empty ordered array of configured `{ provider, model, weight? }` targets. Duplicate provider/model pairs are rejected. |
| `targets[].weight` | No | `1` | Integer from 1 to 10,000. Used by round-robin and random; ignored by failover, least-used, and reset-window. |
| `strategy` | No | `"failover"` | `"failover"`, `"round-robin"`, `"random"`, `"least-used"`, or `"reset-window"`. |
| `stickyLimit` | No | `1` | Integer from 1 to 100 successful requests per round-robin selection. Applies only to round-robin. |
| `defaultEffort` | No | `null` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, or `ultra`; applied only when the caller omits effort and the target advertises support. |
| `reasoningEffortMode` | No | `"strict"` | `"strict"` intersects every known target ladder, so one target advertising no effort control empties the combo's picker. `"adaptive"` excludes those empty ladders from the published intersection. Metadata only; dispatch is unchanged. |
| `imageInput` | No | `"auto"` | `"auto"` or `"disabled"`. `"auto"` publishes image support only when every target supports images; `"disabled"` forces text-only (drops image from published modalities and rejects image-bearing requests before dispatch). |
| `alias` | No | none | Optional trimmed public model id; use the alias rules above. An empty value is stored as no alias. |
| `nativeAlias` | No | `false` | Explicitly permit a currently supported bare native `alias` to take routing and catalog precedence. Never inferred from the alias. |
| `displayName` | No | none | Bounded display-only catalog label. Required and non-empty when `nativeAlias` is true. |

## Troubleshooting

### Why does `combo/<id>` return 404?

The combo id is unknown. The response is HTTP 404 with type `invalid_request_error`. Run
`ocx combo list`, check spelling and case, and confirm your management command wrote to the same
running opencodex instance that receives model requests.

### Why do I get `combo_unavailable`?

Every target is currently ineligible: for example, its provider is disabled, it is cooling down,
it has already been attempted for this request, or an encrypted v2 task excludes it. Check target
provider state and recent upstream errors. For cooldowns, wait for the 60-second default or the
upstream `Retry-After` period (never more than 10 minutes), then retry.

### Why was my alias rejected?

Check the alias grammar and reserved names first. A duplicate alias or invalid shape is rejected as
HTTP 400. A slashed alias whose first segment is a configured Codex account namespace is rejected
as HTTP 409; choose a different alias namespace. The CLI and dashboard display the server's exact
validation message.

### Why did failover stop after the first error?

The error was terminal rather than target-specific. Fix invalid input, reduce an oversized context,
handle a policy refusal, or correct the rejected request origin. Combos do not hop for those cases.
