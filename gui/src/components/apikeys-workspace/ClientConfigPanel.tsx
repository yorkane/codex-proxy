 * Client config export panel (devlog 260731_client_config_export/040, reshaped by
 * 260802/010).
 *
 * One compact row per export client — mark, name, destination, model count, and the
 * two transport actions. The config bytes are NOT rendered at rest: they are cargo the
 * user moves to another file, not an answer the page owes them, so inspection lives
 * behind `Details`. Both transport actions stay on the surface at all times.
 *
 * Still renders only what `GET /api/client-config` returns; it never builds a config
 * locally, so the bytes copied here are the bytes `ocx export` writes.
