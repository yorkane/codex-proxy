/**
 * 429 credential failover is a safety net, not a routing policy.
 *
 * Three rotators existed with three different activation rules: `apiKeyPool` rotated on presence,
 * generic OAuth rotated on presence but could be switched off, and Anthropic rotated only behind
 * `anthropicAccountPool.enabled` -- which defaults absent. So an operator with two Claude accounts
 * logged in and a stock config got a hard 429 with the second account sitting idle.
 *
 * These tests pin the separation that resolves it: REACTIVE rotation (after upstream refused)
 * activates on presence and cannot be disabled, while PROACTIVE routing (affinity, quota-ranked
 * new-session selection, strategy, autoSwitchThreshold) stays behind the opt-in flag.
