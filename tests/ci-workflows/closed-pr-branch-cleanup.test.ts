/**
 * Deletion planning for .github/scripts/closed-pr-branch-cleanup.cjs.

 * selected any branch whose same-NAME historical pull requests were all closed,
 * without checking that the branch still pointed at one of their head commits.
 * A `codex/`-style name reused for new work inherited the closed history of
 * every PR that had ever carried that label.
