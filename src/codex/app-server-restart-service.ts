/**
 * Dashboard-driven Codex app-server restart (#1046 follow-up).
 *
 * The defect: Codex builds a static model manager from the catalog once at
 * app-server startup and never rereads the file, so an app-server that outlives a
 * catalog write serves a roster that no longer exists on disk. Detection already
 * existed and already fired — but it warns on stderr, and the thing keeping an SSH
 * workspace's app-server alive is the Codex app, not a human at a terminal.
 *
 * This module is the consent boundary the startup path deliberately refuses to
 * cross (see `warnIfStaleCodexAppServersAfterStartupWrite`): a login is not consent
 * to interrupt an in-flight turn, but a dashboard click is.
 *
 * The route is a thin adapter over these two functions. Decisions live here so a
 * test can drive every branch through {@link CodexRestartServiceIo} instead of
 * mocking modules — a route test that could not stub this would really terminate
 * the developer's own Codex.
 *
 * Plan and audit history: `devlog/_fin/260815_gui_codex_restart/010_phase1_backend_endpoint.md`.
