 * - The app folds metadata by replaying every `session_meta` line in file order, last-writer-wins
 *   (codex-rs `apply_session_meta_from_item`), so a trailing `session_meta` overrides earlier ones.
 *   Real rollouts already contain multiple `session_meta` lines for this reason.
 * O_APPEND makes each write land at EOF atomically, so it composes safely with the app appending
 * concurrently. We do not touch mtime: a fresh mtime is correct here (the app uses mtime as the
 * rollout's updated_at), and forcing it backwards could hide a real edit from list ordering.

/**
 * Patch the `model_provider` value inside the FIRST line of a rollout *in place, length-preserving*.
 *
 * Why this exists in addition to {@link appendRolloutLine}: Codex resolves a thread's provider via
 * two different readers. The SQLite replay path folds every `session_meta` line last-writer-wins
 * (covered by appending a trailing meta), but `read_session_meta_line` reads only the FIRST line
 * and `update_thread_metadata` clones it when the app later writes git/memory-mode metadata
 * (codex-rs `thread-store/src/local/update_thread_metadata.rs`). If the first line still says
 * `opencodex` after a native restore, that clone re-appends `opencodex` and last-writer-wins
 * resurrects the routed provider. So a durable restore must also fix line 1.
 *
 * Safety: Codex parses each rollout line as `serde_json::from_str(line.trim())`, which tolerates
 * insignificant JSON whitespace. We therefore replace the provider value and pad the removed bytes
 * with spaces so the line's byte length is unchanged. Equal length means we can write at offset 0
 * with no truncate and no inode swap, so this composes safely with the app's cached append handle.
 * A previous shrink leaves JSON whitespace in the token slot. That padding is part of the slot,
 * so an exact restore can later grow "openai" back to "opencodex" without moving any bytes.
 *
 * Distinguishes an already-correct line from an unsafe one so exact restore never consumes its
 * manifest after only the trailing metadata was repaired.
