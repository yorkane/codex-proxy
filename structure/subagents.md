# Subagents And Multi-Agent Surface

Native result continuations and function-result injection follow [the mode-specific result and control contract](transports/streaming-health.md#experimental-native-function-result-injection); this surface does not infer upstream support or alter its defaults.
Explicit Codex CLI installation observation does not attest the runtime used by a subagent or change agent selection. See the [read-only observation contract](runtime.md#explicit-codex-cli-installation-observation).

Native steering follows [the shared WebSocket contract](transports/streaming-health.md#experimental-native-mid-turn-steering); this surface's defaults remain unchanged.

Encrypted-task and fallback request handling follow the Responses
[core module ownership](transports/responses.md#core-module-ownership). This surface retains its existing behavior.

Catalog HTTP acquisition follows the [proxy-routing contract](catalog.md#remote-catalog-http-proxy-routing).

Concurrent refreshes triggered by independent agent work share the [credential refresh-lock contract](catalog.md#accounts-namespaces-and-pool-rotation); unknown lock identity remains available for stale recovery rather than immediate removal, and a failed path probe cannot mask the callback outcome. Cooperating lock metadata changes serialize through the existing SQLite mutation transaction; release keeps the descriptor open through identity comparison and any unlink, then closes it. Failed metadata writes remove only a matching owned path after successful coordination; unknown identity, failed probes or unavailable coordination retain the path for stale recovery. Async refresh work holds no metadata transaction.

CLI installation inspection reason codes, including Windows deferral, follow the [runtime inspection contract](runtime.md#lifecycle).

## Plaintext V2 agent messages

`src/responses/plaintext-v2-agent-messages.ts` owns the experimental, configuration-only
`plaintextV2AgentMessages` request compiler and response restoration. The default is unset;
only explicit true on Responses ingress to the final canonical ChatGPT forward route activates it.
A default top-level collaboration catalog is required. The compiler preserves caller objects,
aliases the namespace and three message functions, and removes only their true encryption marker.
Declaration/reference collisions refuse the whole rewrite without changing the request.

`src/adapters/openai-responses.ts` returns request-local alias capabilities. The Responses core
refreshes them after every request rebuild and restores JSON, SSE and WebSocket identities after
snapshot repair. Malformed, conflicting, unsupported or over-limit responses fail closed without
retrying the model. Raw stream inspection cannot publish plaintext continuation state: only
restored client blocks reach its dedicated bounded collector. Foreign namespaces and opaque
argument/metadata values remain unchanged; the empty encrypted-function-args marker is preserved.

Startup warns that task text can remain in Codex history, selected-provider requests and local
response/debug state. This is application-level plaintext over HTTPS, depends on undocumented
upstream behavior, and does not decrypt existing tasks or replace authenticated recovery.

Restored calls and selectors carry an explicit collaboration namespace and unqualified child name.
Codex treats qualified names literally and defaults absent namespaces to functions. Only child
declarations inherit their restored namespace container; the compiler never invents an empty
encryption marker when the upstream omitted it or returned a nonempty marker.

Shared parsing and streaming follow the [request-copy](transports/byte-accounting.md#request-copy-accounting) and [stream-buffer accounting](transports/byte-accounting.md#stream-buffer-accounting) contracts. Response-attached WebSocket telemetry follows the [stage record identity contract](transports/responses.md#passthrough-sse-stream-shapes-314).

Pool credentials used by subagent routes can be
[linked to Orca-managed homes](codex-home.md#orca-source-owned-account-import). The account-store
resolver enforces source identity and expiry before those credentials reach routing.

## Multi-agent surface mode (3-state)

`OcxConfig.multiAgentMode` controls the `multi_agent_version` field stamped on catalog entries:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `"v1"` | Force ALL entries to `multi_agent_version = "v1"` ??overrides upstream pins (sol/terra included). |
| `"default"` | Respect upstream model pins (sol/terra=v2, luna=v1, others=null ??codex feature flag decides). On sync, stale forced values are cleared and upstream pins restored. |
| `"v2"` | Force ALL entries to `multi_agent_version = "v2"` ??overrides upstream pins (luna included). |

The override is applied as a final pass in both `buildCatalogEntries` (live `/v1/models` path) and
`mergeCatalogEntriesForSync` (on-disk sync), AFTER all normalization and visibility processing. This
ensures `normalizeRoutedCatalogEntry` (which deletes `multi_agent_version` from routed entries) does
not clobber the forced value.

`getDefaultConfig()` (`src/config/proxy-env.ts`) writes `multiAgentMode: "v1"` explicitly, using the version
constant from `src/config/multi-agent-surface.ts`, so v1 is the install default while a v2
native-to-routed child task is undeliverable ciphertext. The repair and salvage merges in
`src/config/diagnostics.ts` pin `multiAgentMode` and `multiAgentSurfaceAdvisoryVersion` to the stored
document, because spreading the defaults underneath would repair an unrelated missing field
into a surface change its operator never made.
An absent key still means `"default"`, because selecting base deletes the key ??absence cannot be
read as "never configured". An install that predates that change is therefore not rewritten; it is
asked once. `multiAgentSurfaceAdvisoryRequired()` is true while the resolved mode is not v1 and
the stored `multiAgentSurfaceAdvisoryVersion` is below `MULTI_AGENT_SURFACE_ADVISORY_VERSION`, and
only the operator answering the dashboard notice writes that version.

CLI: `ocx v2 mode v1|default|v2`. GUI: segmented control on the Models page. API: `GET/PUT /api/v2`
with `multiAgentMode` field.

The `multi_agent_v2` feature flag and the logical maximum thread count are separate from
`multiAgentMode` (`src/codex/features.ts`): the mode decides which surface Codex advertises, while
the flag and thread count decide what the native runtime allows.

`keepNativeChatGptOnV1` makes mode `v2` a catalog-driven hybrid: OpenCodex disables the global
`multi_agent_v2` override because codex-rs resolves that override before a model row's explicit
`multi_agent_version`. Native ChatGPT rows then select v1 from the catalog and routed rows select
v2. An explicit attempt to enable the global flag while the hybrid pin is active is rejected.

### What the five-model `spawn_agent` window is, and how V1 differs from V2

`MAX_SPAWN_AGENT_MODEL_OVERRIDES = 5` (mirrored in `src/codex/catalog/subagent-roster.ts`) is **not** a
subagent concurrency limit and **not** an eligibility limit. Upstream uses it in exactly two
places: the model list rendered into the `spawn_agent` tool description
(`multi_agents_spec.rs:789`) and the "Available models:" suggestions in an unknown-model error
(`multi_agents_common.rs:448`, inside the `ok_or_else` closure that runs only *after* the lookup
already failed). The success path `find_spawn_agent_model_name` (`:431-442`) scans the whole
catalog with neither the cap nor a `show_in_picker` filter, so a model outside the advertised
five is still accepted when named exactly.

Three different numbers, often conflated:

| Quantity | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Models **advertised** as overrides | `min(5, picker-visible eligible rows)` | `multi_agents_spec.rs:785-790` |
| Models **eligible** as targets | no numeric cap (only `"disabled"` is excluded, and only on V2) | `multi_agents_common.rs:36-42` |
| **Concurrent** subagents | V1 6 children (root excluded); V2 total 4 including root ??3 children | `config/mod.rs:211-212`, `:1497-1506` |

**The cap is the same 5 on both surfaces, but the window's contents are not.** The eligibility
filter runs *before* `.take(5)`, and it behaves differently per surface: on a V1 call
`model_supports_multi_agent_backend` short-circuits true for every row (including `disabled`
ones), while a V2 call drops `Some(Disabled)` first ??which lets a later row move into the five.
Same catalog, different advertised list:

| # | Model | pin | V1 advertises | V2 advertises |
| ---: | --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | `v2-a` | `v2` | ??| ??|
| 2 | `disabled-a` | `disabled` | ??| ??|
| 3 | `v1-a` | `v1` | ??| ??|
| 4 | `null-a` | absent | ??| ??|
| 5 | `v2-b` | `v2` | ??| ??|
| 6 | `disabled-b` | `disabled` | ??| ??|
| 7 | `null-b` | absent | ??| ??|

opencodex already matches this: `effectiveSubagentRoster` filters with
`surface !== "v2" || isEligibleV2SubagentEntry(entry)`, so the V1 path skips the eligibility
filter exactly as upstream does. opencodex also injects no roster on V1
(`src/server/responses/collaboration.ts` emits only proactive text at the top effort tier), so
the upstream tool description remains the authority there.

Two further V1/V2 differences worth knowing: the list gate is
`hide_agent_type_model_reasoning` on V1 (hard-coded `false` at registration, so V1 always
advertises) but `expose_spawn_agent_model_overrides` on V2 (default `true`; when false the list
is omitted *and* the `model`/`reasoning_effort` schema fields are removed). And V2's
`hide_spawn_agent_metadata` defaults true, which removes `service_tier`.

`modelPickerOrder` (#1649) separates **OpenCodex guidance** from native advertisement.
`SPAWN_PRIORITY_FIELD` preserves the natural priority used by `effectiveSubagentRoster`, so
OpenCodex's preferred/guidance candidate calculation stays independent of display order.
Native Codex ignores that private field: its advertised five on V1 and exposed V2 follow the
native `priority` and may change when the picker is reordered. Exact-name override lookup is
not restricted to those five advertised rows. V1 receives no OpenCodex preferred-roster
injection; V2 can additionally receive natural-priority guidance when its catalog state permits.
The helper tests pin guidance behavior, not native tool-description equivalence.

A nonblank bare id in `modelPickerOrder` opts into complete-picker display ordering. Exact
ids take precedence over raw/encoded equivalents; routed-only and empty lists keep the legacy
ordering behavior. This does not change the separate `opencodex_spawn_priority` contract.
Retained rows recompute their natural ranks from the current featured roster and account-selector
stride before display order is applied, so a discovery outage cannot preserve an obsolete
featured or picker rank. Canonical `opencode-go` rows retain their configured reasoning ladder
and provider-scoped context metadata both when generated and when merged from retained catalog
state; `deepseek-v4.1-flash` therefore keeps its 1,048,576-token window, while synthetic max/ultra
choices are not added to that provider's declared ladder.
`meta-muse` declares `max` for both seeded models under the [Muse provider contract](providers-and-adapters.md), so routed-client catalogs can expose it without extending OpenCode Go's ladder.
The first-party DeepSeek `deepseek-flash` row declares native `text` and `image` input and therefore
does not require the vision sidecar by default; explicit `noVisionModels` or text-only declarations
remain authoritative. First-party `deepseek-chat`, `deepseek-reasoner`, and `deepseek-v4-flash`
remain sidecar-backed by default. OpenCode Go's `deepseek-v4.1-flash` was reclassified as native
vision on 2026-09-19 (probed on that gateway); its sibling `deepseek-v4-flash` stays sidecar-backed,
and the Zen tiers keep their classification because they could not be measured.

## Multipart encrypted task recovery

`src/server/responses/agent-task-recovery.ts` admits at most 32 consecutive, individually complete
Fernet-shaped parts with a combined 2 MiB ciphertext limit. Every encrypted slot must belong to
that run. The existing credential admission precedes cache access; the cache key includes an
unambiguous ordered sequence. One fixed-endpoint request forwards separate parts, and assignment
replacement compares the complete original item snapshot before splicing the run. Recovery output
is model-transcribed plaintext, not cryptographic fidelity proof, and no internal outage retry is added.

`src/server/responses/encrypted-payload.ts` uses bounded concatenation only to recognize otherwise
unreadable split-token shapes. The sanitizer preserves just those fragment objects and continues
normalizing independent plaintext slots. Detection never authorizes reconstruction or recovery;
other fragment layouts and mixed readable content retain their documented residual boundaries.

## Routed agent-message ciphertext egress

Two questions about an `agent_message` were asked in two places, and the gap between them was
open. `hasUnreadableEncryptedAgentTask` asks whether the CURRENT worker task can be read and
inspects only the tail item; `normalizeRoutedAgentMessages` asks whether EVERY part can be lowered
onto a public message and forwards the private item verbatim when one cannot. An item mixing
`input_text` with `encrypted_content` is readable by the first measure and unlowerable by the
second, so it passed the guard, kept its private type through the raw Responses passthrough, and
left the process as backend ciphertext plus an item type only the Codex backend declares. The
destination answered `422 unknown item type "agent_message"` after the bytes were already sent.
Position was incidental: a replayed child result sits mid-history, where a tail-only scan cannot
see it, and the tail is exposed the same way once it is mixed.

The repair already existed reactively. `prepareOpaqueBlobRecovery` replaces an undecryptable part
with `[encrypted content omitted]`, which leaves the item lowerable, and it ran after an upstream
rejection. A destination that cannot accept the private item under any circumstances was never
going to answer that request, so the round trip only served to send the ciphertext.
`stripAgentMessageCiphertextInPlace` in `src/server/responses/encrypted-payload.ts` applies the
same repair before dispatch, and `src/server/responses/core.ts` runs it against the final route,
after `expandPreviousResponseInput`, after the sanitizer has rewritten plaintext parked in
encrypted slots, and after encrypted-task recovery has had its chance to produce real plaintext
instead of a marker.

The two kinds of slot are judged differently, because they carry different guarantees. An
`encrypted_content` slot holds ciphertext by definition, so it is stripped whatever it holds:
demanding a well-formed token there would reopen the same defect one payload later, since a
truncated token, a standard-base64 blob carrying `+` or `/`, an unexpected version byte, or a run
past the recovery size limits would each keep the item and forward the bytes. A text part carries
no such guarantee, so it is matched strictly -- embedded runs that validate as Fernet, or a whole
slot with the Fernet wire shape, which is the version prefix, the base64url alphabet and a
canonical length of at least 100 divisible by four. Adjacent text fragments are joined before that
test, so a token split across slots is still caught. `looksLikeBackendCiphertext` is deliberately
NOT used on text: it is length >= 64 over a character class that a SHA-256 digest matches exactly
at 64 characters, and replacing a digest a child deliberately printed would delete readable content
to protect bytes that were never secret. Other item types are untouched: reasoning and
function-output blobs keep the reactive opaque-blob recovery, which still rescues a destination
that merely failed to decrypt something it was entitled to read, and which stays reachable for the
canonical backend and for explicitly trusted routes.

The repair resolves the same wire override the adapter is built from rather than restating routing
policy, and runs for `openai-responses` whenever the destination is not the canonical Codex
backend. `authMode: "forward"` is deliberately not that test: it describes how this proxy treats
credentials, not who answers, and a forward-configured gateway at another origin receives the
ciphertext like any third party. Only `isCanonicalOpenAiForwardProvider` is exempt, because it
alone minted these bytes and can read them. The wire override matters for the reported destination,
where the provider row names the Chat wire and a registry model default moves the model onto
Responses. Translated wires are untouched because `inputContentParts` drops an encrypted part
instead of forwarding it, and `canPassThroughEncryptedV2AgentTask` keeps an explicitly trusted
route exempt. Combo children run the repair themselves: `concreteComboRequestBody` gives each
target its own `structuredClone` and its own concrete route, so a sibling's repair is invisible to
them and a target resolving to a routed Responses wire would otherwise send what the parent's own
dispatch no longer does.

Nothing here decrypts, and the tail NEW_TASK envelope keeps `unreadable_encrypted_agent_task` and
its opt-in recovery unchanged: an unreadable current task still fails closed rather than reaching a
child with a marker where its assignment should be. An `agent_message` carrying unknown parts but
no ciphertext still reaches the wire unchanged and still draws the destination's own 422, which is
a compatibility gap rather than an egress one. Covered by
`tests/server/v2-agent-message-failfast.test.ts`.

## Subagents

New non-OAuth provider registrations carry `initialModelSelection` with a unique
registration identity. Until reliable live/static discovery completes, public
catalogs and model candidates withhold those providers' models; the provider itself
stays active. At 20 or more canonical Models switch rows, initialization appends
all corresponding disabled selectors once. Existing registrations and later manual
choices are not reinitialized. OAuth/ChatGPT forwarding is exempt using the same
usable-key override predicate as routing. Display aliases do not add switch rows.

`src/providers/initial-model-selection-runtime.ts` commits the decision against a
matching registration/inventory snapshot before catalog authority is captured.
Ordinary management discovery also completes it with Codex integration OFF. The
final catalog merge fences pending retained rows, including delete/re-add recovery.
Raw management rows remain visible as pending/OFF. Config listener bindings are
excluded from inventory identity because live and persisted bindings may differ.

Codex `spawn_agent` advertises only the highest-priority first five picker-visible catalog rows.
Use at most five configured `subagentModels` ids; they may contain bare catalog ids, routed
`provider/model` ids, or exact account-qualified `<selector>/<native-openai-model>` ids. The
dashboard offers bare native and routed choices; exact account-qualified choices are configured
through `ocx agent subagents set` or the opencodex configuration. Retired native rows are
excluded by the [shared catalog](catalog.md#shared-catalog); saved user choices are not rewritten
by that retirement. Quota fallback retains independent shared/Reserve evidence.

When account selectors are active, one featured bare native id expands into a complete selector row
group. Catalog priorities use the selector count as a stride so each group stays together without
widening Codex's five-row advertisement window. Fresh defaults are Astra, Sol, Terra, Luna, 5.5.
Startup upgrades unmarked rosters once: prepend `gpt-6-astra`, retain the first four unique
non-Astra choices, then move retained bare `gpt-5.5` last. The old fifth choice is dropped;
an unmarked empty list becomes Astra only, and an unset list receives the fresh defaults.
`subagentModelsVersion: 1` records completion, so later user edits (including an empty list or
removing Astra) persist. The migration rebases on the latest disk config under the existing
mutation lock; failed persistence degrades to an in-memory roster for that run without a stale
whole-config overwrite. Existing disabled-model visibility rules remain unchanged.

Quota-aware fallback walks a configured chain when the featured model is exhausted, probing
availability on a bounded interval (default 60 s, `src/codex/subagent-model-fallback.ts`). It rewrites
the requested model id only; effort remains owned by the caps described under
[Ultra reasoning level](catalog.md#ultra-reasoning-level).

`injectionModel` and `injectionEffort` are shared selections with two independent consumers.
`multiAgentGuidanceEnabled` controls only OpenCodex-authored delegation guidance.
`syncCodexSubagentDefaults` is a separate, default-off opt-in that applies the selected values to
Codex's native `[agents]` defaults on sync/restart for newly created Codex tasks when OpenCodex owns
the active Codex routing; external user-managed provider configs remain untouched. It does not itself
cause delegation. The TOML edit owns only marker-tagged values, preserves existing unmarked
user-owned `[agents]` defaults rather than overwriting them, and rejects ambiguous table shapes
without changing the file.

An explicit desktop restart to load those defaults follows the [runtime membership checks](runtime.md#codex-desktop-process-membership); selecting a delegation model does not authorize additional restart targets.

V2 proxy guidance uses `<opencodex_subagent_guidance>` for both built-in metadata and
custom `injectionPrompt` bodies. The built-in text reports the resolved preferred model,
effort, roster and fallback chain without prescribing delegation, spawn overrides or
`fork_turns`. Custom bodies retain their placeholder behavior. The guidance switch and
catalog-state gates still apply; stale or unknown catalog state suppresses proxy guidance.
V1 uses the shared `MULTI_AGENT_MODE_HINT_RECOMMENDATION.text` inside `<multi_agent_mode>`
at `max` or `ultra`. Only the separate explicit delegation-request trigger changes; user,
authority, task-scope and collaboration-tool rules remain applicable. This is guidance,
not an enforcement mechanism or a change to native settings or tool access.

Replay deduplication compares the latest exact generated developer text separately for
each tag family, preserving built-in ??custom ??built-in transitions without duplicating
unchanged proxy metadata after a native policy change. Native and legacy-tagged history
remain intact: tags do not establish historical authorship or revoke old instructions,
and mixed-version transition detection is not guaranteed.

The native mode hint is separate from proxy guidance and native `[agents]` defaults.
`src/codex/multi-agent-mode-policy.ts` owns the proactive recommendation; the dashboard
obtains it from `/api/v2` rather than maintaining its own preset. An explicit dashboard,
API or CLI hint write passes through `setMultiAgentModeHintText`, which replaces only
the two byte-exact released OpenCodex presets with the current recommendation. Other
valid custom text, including whitespace variants, is preserved. Reads, unrelated writes
and upgrades do not migrate stored hints. The writer retains its native capability check
and stores only `features.multi_agent_v2.multi_agent_mode_hint_text` in Codex TOML;
`null` removes that key. The hint affects new native Codex sessions when their v2 surface
is active, without changing reasoning effort or the proxy guidance switch.

Claude Code `ocx-*` agent definitions consume the same effective `claudeCode.blockedSkills` policy
as inbound bundle elision. When the list is non-empty (default: `claude-api`), generated definitions
whose marker-stripped model resolves to a routed id receive a preventive instruction not to invoke
those skills. Direct `provider/model` selectors are routed even when their inbound resolution is
identity. The only unguarded `ocx-self` case is an identity-resolved `claude|anthropic` model while
native passthrough is enabled; `modelMap` claims and `nativePassthrough:false` restore the guard. The
guard avoids creating oversized skill messages before the proxy can intervene; inbound elision remains
the fallback if a client still sends a blocked bundle. An explicit empty list disables both routed-model
behaviors.

### Saved picker presets

The Models page saves routed snapshots in `modelPickerOrder` and records their origin in
`modelPickerOrderMode` (`alphabetical`, `provider`, `most-used`). Mode is UI provenance, not a
catalog sorting policy: catalog writers consume the saved array. Routed-only featured/native
bands and complete-picker natural-rank preservation remain as described above. Public
`buildCatalogEntries` accepts the order as its final argument and applies the complete-order
pass after building. On-disk convergence retains its existing post-merge final pass.

Claude ModelInfo ordering receives optional `{ modelPickerOrder, featured }` after `fastRows`.
It orders routed output groups after alias deduplication, preserving the collision winner and
base/1M/Fast siblings. Native groups and explicit Desktop profile ownership are unchanged.
Native Codex advertisements still follow display priority; private guidance ranks do not freeze them.

Codex display-cache expiry, retained blocking main-policy evidence, and reset history follow the
[quota cache contract](providers/openai-tiers.md#quota-cache-and-short-window-history).

Usage consumers preserve positive incomplete-history metadata as specified in [usage accounting](gui-and-management-api.md#usage-accounting); readable totals are not represented as a complete ledger. Upstream API-key usage follows the [physical-attempt account attribution contract](gui-and-management-api.md#upstream-key-account-attribution), independently of subscription quota observations.

Connected CLI usage follows the [client-scoped hub usage contract](gui-and-management-api.md#usage-accounting); local management and account data remain separate.

Remote Workspace uses a separate, explicitly enabled server surface with structural WebSocket callbacks and awaited per-server cleanup; [its contract](remote-workspace.md) owns that integration.

Listener startup diagnostics follow [the runtime lifecycle contract](runtime.md#lifecycle); malformed optional listener blocks follow [config loading](config.md#config-surface).
Chat helper admission in `src/server/responses/core.ts` follows the
[deferred stored-main contract](providers/openai-tiers.md): only a needed Direct OpenAI helper
claims stored main, after terminal vision, routed vision and search exclusions.

Subagent automatic pool preview returns no candidate when all pool plans are excluded; explicit account-qualified models retain the [selection-policy distinction](providers/openai-tiers.md#automatic-pool-plan-exclusions).

Provider-level Combo eligibility uses explicit inference evidence for the current single credential; account-specific admission remains separate. See [scoped provider quota](runtime.md#scoped-provider-quota-for-combo-selection).

The management quota DTO keeps Combo editing aligned with scoped inference evidence;
see [Combo editor routing quota](gui-and-management-api.md#combo-editor-routing-quota).

Optional Codex transport-hint suppression is scoped to canonical Responses client output;
its defaults and exclusions are owned by [Responses transport](transports/responses.md).

Final-route summary visibility is recomputed after fallback from the original Responses preference; an earlier provider opt-in does not carry into a later provider. See [reasoning presentation](providers/chat-compat.md).

Paginated and migration-capable history follows the [authoritative writer contract](codex-home.md#paginated-history-writer-boundary); this document adds no independent writer guarantee.

Codex pool settings and their consumers follow the [reset-first ordering contract](providers/openai-tiers.md#reset-first-account-ordering), including independent-quota fallback, preserved affinity, strategy-specific threshold summaries, and shared short-observation freshness for switch warnings.

Claude replay carries [Go conversation affinity](data-planes/inbound-compat.md#claude-affinity-at-final-go-dispatch)
privately to final dispatch; preliminary route selection does not inject Go-only headers.

Native Chat applies qualifying effort ceilings independently of model pins; pin selection precedes the cap and only pins or cap rewrites enter wire mapping. The [catalog effort contract](catalog.md#ultra-reasoning-level) records the V1/compaction exemptions and caller-preservation boundary.

Private pool credential metadata follows the [quota-history publication identity contract](providers/openai-tiers.md#quota-history-publication-identity); credential-only and account DTO projections omit it.

Pool quota producers and account commands follow the [bounded raw-observation contract](providers/openai-tiers.md#bounded-pool-quota-observations), separate from the latest display snapshot and capacity estimates.

The account history response can include a [low-confidence effective capacity estimate](providers/openai-tiers.md#observed-effective-token-capacity); usage normalization retains local-answer provenance so local responses cannot supply samples.

Account quota surfaces use [safe probe diagnostics](transports/inventory.md#account-quota-failure-diagnostics) separately from quota validity, credential health and routing authority.

Combo child requests normalize effort and thinking controls against the selected target while retaining reasoning summaries; strict unknown targets preserve caller controls. The [Responses transport owner](transports/responses.md) documents this boundary, and native Chat removes effort only for an explicit empty declaration or no-reasoning model.

Live sideband admission and its bounded upstream handshake follow the [runtime contract](runtime.md#live-sideband-handshake); the ordinary Responses WebSocket exchange remains separate.

The [explicit model-capability contract](config.md#explicit-per-model-capability-declarations) preserves operator declarations through provider storage and catalog capture; it does not infer upstream capability or change this surface's routing behavior.

Exact [model input declarations](config.md#explicit-per-model-capability-declarations) now feed text-only eligibility and catalog hints; existing image-description/omission handling consumes them before the main upstream send.

That shared rule includes the Crusoe registry entry's five explicit text-and-image model ids;
subagent eligibility consumes the same derived metadata as the main catalog and does not infer
vision support from a provider-wide multimodal label.

[Anthropic seed image metadata](runtime.md#capability-aware-image-admission) supplies missing capability evidence; subagent selection and eligibility rules remain unchanged.

Opper's fallback pool seeds carry provider-scoped text/image declarations from
`src/providers/registry/model-seeds.ts`. They feed the same capability-aware image admission and
do not change subagent selection, roster order, or eligibility.

Provider-scoped approval reviewer settings are projected by the [catalog owner](catalog.md#provider-scoped-approval-reviewer); this surface retains its existing routing, transport and account-selection behavior.

Renamed fixed-key providers receive [missing reasoning metadata](catalog.md#renamed-destination-reasoning-metadata) during derivation; explicit per-model entries and provider defaults retain precedence.

Shared response-log retention and native SSE inspection pacing follow the [bounded inspection contract](transports/byte-accounting.md#response-log-inspection); other subsystem behavior remains unchanged.

Native steering retains fixed phase deadlines and reconciled replay output; see the [steering stability contract](transports/streaming-health.md#steering-deadlines-and-replay-completeness).

Native steering generation overrides, explicit public-API eligibility and the consent-gated wire probe follow the [shared control contract](transports/streaming-health.md#steering-settings-public-api-and-diagnostic-probe); this owner does not change routing or execute diagnostic tools.

Startup provider-id migration preserves the account binding between configuration and OAuth credentials; see the [runtime contract](runtime.md).

Dashboard Fast-row persistence and client refresh follow the [Fast selector rows setting contract](gui-and-management-api.md#fast-selector-rows-setting).

The [compaction routing override](transports/responses.md#compaction-routing-overrides) uses explicit request-kind and trigger metadata, independently of spawned-child markers.
