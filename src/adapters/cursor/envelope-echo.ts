 * Drop echoed tool-result envelopes from assistant history before Cursor root replay.

 * The prefix sniffer catches an echo that STARTS a turn, but grok-4.6 routinely writes a real
 * sentence first and pastes the envelope after it. That text has already reached the client and
 * is stored as assistant output, so replaying it verbatim re-primes the next turn with the very
 * envelope the model is copying.
 *
 * Scope starts AT the marker line and runs to the next blank line, rather than to the end of
 * the message. The echoed envelope has no terminator we can recognise — we build it as a marker
 * line plus arbitrary result text (protobuf-request.ts), and the observed copies are not
 * byte-exact, so matching against the replayed envelope is not available either. Truncating to
 * the end of the message was the alternative, and it discards a genuine answer whenever the
 * model resumes after the echo. A blank line is the one boundary the model reliably writes when
 * it goes back to prose.
 *
 * The tradeoff is explicit: an echoed envelope whose pasted result itself contains a blank line
 * leaves its remainder in replay. That is the safer direction to be wrong in — conversation
 * remint, not this filter, is the primary defence against a poisoned conversation, and this only
 * stops the transcript from feeding itself.
 *
 * Only whole-line markers count, so prose such as "the string [Tool Result] appeared" survives.
