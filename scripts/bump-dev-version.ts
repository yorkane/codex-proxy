/**
 * Decide the version `dev` should carry after a release publishes.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * `scripts/release.ts` runs only on `main` or `preview` (`allowedBranches`), bumps
 * `package.json` there, and pushes that branch. `release.yml` ends at "Create GitHub
 * release". Nothing advances `dev`. So the moment a release publishes, `dev` carries a
 * version that is at or behind a published one, and
 * `tests/ci-workflows/release-version-line.test.ts` fails on `dev` and on every pull request opened
 * against it — inherited red that a contributor cannot fix from their own diff.
 *
 * That has been repaired by hand four times: `32529c2b2`, `e4a85d134`, `076ad3036`,
 * `befcac3e1`. The second of those ADDED the detector, and two more repairs followed
 * it, which is the evidence that visibility was never the missing piece.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT
 *
 * This decides a version. It does no git and no network work, which is what makes it
 * unit-testable and what keeps the credential surface in the workflow that calls it.
 * It does not merge anything: `.github/workflows/dev-version-bump.yml` uses the
 * output to open a pull request, and a human still merges that. Until they do, the
 * red persists. This is a prepared repair, not an automatic one.
 *
 * THE RULE
 *
 * Not "increment the minor". That contradicts `befcac3e1`, which moved `dev` from
 * `2.35.0` to `2.36.0` when the published tag was `v2.36.0-preview.20260829`:
 * incrementing the released core's minor would have skipped the stable `2.36.0` that
 * had not shipped yet.
 *
 * Not "lowest unused stable" either, however natural that sounds. "Unused" is a
 * property of the tag set and the npm registry, and a function with no I/O cannot
 * evaluate it. Stating the rule that way would make this file unimplementable as
 * specified.
 *
 * The rule is therefore about the published version's SHAPE, which is the only thing
 * this function can see:
 *
 *   published `X.Y.Z-preview.*`  ->  dev becomes `X.Y.Z`     (befcac3e1)
 *   published `X.Y.Z` (stable)   ->  dev becomes `X.(Y+1).0` (e4a85d134, 076ad3036, 32529c2b2)
 *
 * A prerelease means the stable core has not shipped, so `dev` should carry it. A
 * stable release means that core is consumed, so `dev` moves to the next minor.
 *
 * Freeness is then checked where the tag set IS visible: the workflow runs
 * `tests/ci-workflows/release-version-line.test.ts` in the `dev` checkout after the rewrite. If the
 * candidate collides with something published, that test fails, no pull request is
 * opened, and the job goes red asking for a human decision. This file only enforces
 * what it can prove without I/O — that the candidate ranks strictly ahead of both
 * inputs by the repository's own comparator.
