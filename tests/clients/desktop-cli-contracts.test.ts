/**
 * The two CLI surfaces the shell drives, read against the CLI that defines them.
 *
 * D5 and D4: the shell stops resolving the home, the port and liveness itself, and stops performing
 * the teardown itself. `src/cli/resolve.ts` and `src/cli/stop-report.ts` own those answers; the Rust
 * side is a reader. Both halves are asserted here together so a schema, a status value or an
 * outcome name cannot change on one side and be discovered on a user's machine.
 *
 * The rule that matters most is the one a reader can get wrong quietly: liveness has three answers,
 * and only a proven absence authorises starting a runtime. Everything that can go wrong on the
 * shell side has to fold into the third one, because the reading that must never happen is "the
 * resolve failed, so nobody must be listening".
