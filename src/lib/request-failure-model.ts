/**
 * One vocabulary for how far a failed request got, why it failed, and whether this proxy may
 * send it again (roadmap items 7 and 14).
 *
 * These two items are one module on purpose. Item 7 wants a resend decision per failure stage;
 * item 14 wants one cause dictionary spanning logical request, attempt, physical send and
 * terminal. Defined apart they typecheck on each branch and contradict each other in the merge,
 * which is the class that blocked 2.60.0.
 *
 * What lives here is the vocabulary and the decision derived from it. What does NOT live here is
 * a second record store: the durable shapes stay `PersistedUsageAttempt` and
 * `PersistedUsageEntry` in src/usage/log.ts, and every projection below reads those structurally
 * rather than growing a parallel history.
 *
 * MUST stay a leaf. Its one runtime import is `src/usage/telemetry-contract.ts`, which has no
 * imports at all; everything else it names is a type, erased at runtime. So nothing here can
 * pull the usage or budget subsystems into a request path that did not already have them.
