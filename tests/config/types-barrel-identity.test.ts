/**
 * The mega-file split turned `src/types.ts` into a re-export barrel. Its correctness
 * argument was "tsc plus the ~400 files that import through it", which is true for
 * TYPES — they are erased, so a wrong one fails compilation.
 *
 * It is not true for the runtime values. A barrel that copied an implementation, wrapped
 * one, or re-declared a `Set` would typecheck cleanly and pass every existing suite,
 * because no test imported a leaf directly — every import went through the barrel, so
 * barrel and leaf were never compared to each other.
 *
 * A forked `MODEL_ADAPTER_OVERRIDE_ALLOWED` is the concrete hazard: two `Set` instances
 * where the code assumes one, diverging the moment anything mutates or identity-checks it.
 * The original split risk assessment named singleton forking as a MEDIUM program risk and
 * relied on review greps to catch it. This is that check, mechanised.
 *
 * Reference identity is the right assertion: an ESM re-export binds the same object, so
 * `toBe` passes for a genuine re-export and fails for a copy, a wrapper, or a re-declaration.
