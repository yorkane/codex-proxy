# 010 - wp1: Windows triage (NOOP by user instruction)

## Class call

C0 record. No code.

## What happened

wp1 was registered as "Windows dispatch triage, fixes, admin merge to dev" and a
dispatch was started on the dev tip (`9c0e3ca80`, run 33894541984, ref
`codex/win-dispatch-9c0e3ca80`, since deleted). An Aside browser session
(`EMFS4FK4CzBR9nXz`) had begun crawling the issue tracker and the dispatch logs.

The user then said: "윈도우 이슈들은 신경쓰지말고 테스트 구조화만 신경써 그건 다른
친구가 하는중". Windows is owned by someone else. The Aside session was stopped,
the dispatch ref was deleted, and the goalplan was steered with an annotate op
(`idempotencyKey: scope-260905-drop-windows`).

## Outcome

NOOP. The only Windows-related artifact this unit keeps is the timing data in
`003_ci_timing_baseline.md` §5, which records that completed Windows shards run
16.6-23.3 min. Nothing under `src/` or the `platform-windows` job is touched by
any later work-phase; `tests/windows/` in the layout is a directory move only.

Criterion c-1 ("Windows dispatch on final dev tip green 4/4") is waived by the
same instruction and is recorded as met with this doc as the captured evidence.

Closed as NOOP in the session's wp1 cycle on 2026-09-05; the baseline dispatch
33894541984 result, whatever it is, belongs to the Windows owner.
