Pi reads its providers from a single global JSON file rather than environment
variables, so
opencodex does not launch it. Instead, `ocx export` serializes the `opencodex`
provider block —
base URL, model list, and the env reference Pi interpolates — and you merge it
into your own
config.

## Quickstart

Start the proxy, then print the config:

```bash
ocx start
ocx export --client pi
```

The output leads with the JSON, then prints the destination path, the merge
warning, the env
export line, and how many models carry authoritative context limits.

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "opencodex": {
      "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:10100/v1",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "apiKey": "$OPENCODEX_API_KEY",
      "compat": {
        "sendSessionAffinityHeaders": true
      },
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "anthropic/claude-opus-5",
          "name": "Claude Opus 5 (anthropic)",
          "input": ["text"],
          "contextWindow": 200000,
          "maxTokens": 32000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Oluşturulan Pi sağlayıcılarında `compat.sendSessionAffinityHeaders` etkinleştirilir. Sağlayıcıyı birleştirirken veya elle düzenlerken bu ayarı koruyun: Pi sabit bir oturum kimliği gönderir ve OpenCodex bu kimlikten kanonik OpenCode Go hedefi için oturum yakınlığı üretir. `cacheRetention` değeri `none` olduğunda Pi kimliği göndermeyebilir.

Model ids are the proxy's canonical selectors, so routed models appear as
`provider/model`
(`anthropic/claude-opus-5`) and native OpenAI slugs stay unprefixed
(`gpt-5.6-sol`). The `name`
suffix — `(anthropic)`, `(native)`, `(routed)` — is what makes two same-named
models from
different upstreams distinguishable in Pi's picker.

## Where it goes

Pi's global model config is:

```text
~/.pi/agent/models.json
```

:::caution[Merge, never replace]
`ocx export` never writes that file. Merge the `providers.opencodex` block into
it — replacing the
file destroys every other provider you have configured there. `--out` exists for
a scratch path
and refuses to overwrite an existing file without `--force`:

```bash
ocx export --client pi --out ~/opencodex-pi-models.json
ocx export --client pi --json > ~/opencodex-pi-models.json   # or redirect the byte-exact JSON
```

:::

The exported block is a static snapshot, not a live view. Re-run `ocx export`
after adding a
provider or changing model visibility, and merge the new block over the old one.

## The admission key

Two different keys are easy to confuse here, and only the first one appears in
this file:

| Key | What it is | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Proxy admission key | opencodex's own credential, generated on the dashboard's **API** tab | referenced by `apiKey` as `$OPENCODEX_API_KEY`; the value stays in your environment |
| Provider key | your Anthropic / OpenAI / OpenRouter key | opencodex's own config, per [Providers](/guides/providers/) |

The exported config carries only the reference, never a secret. Pi interpolates
a bare `$NAME`, so
the variable is:

```bash
export OPENCODEX_API_KEY=<your key>
```

That name is Pi's alone. opencode uses a different variable
(`OPENCODEX_OPENCODE_API_KEY`, in `{env:…}` form) — see the [opencode
guide](/guides/opencode/).

**A loopback proxy needs no key at all.** opencodex binds `127.0.0.1` by default
and authenticates
nothing there, so the `$OPENCODEX_API_KEY` reference is inert and you can leave
the variable unset.
It matters only when `hostname` is set beyond loopback, which is also the case
where the proxy
refuses to start without a token — see [Remote
access](/reference/configuration/#remote-access).

## Model metadata

`contextWindow` and `maxTokens` are emitted only when the catalog reports an
authoritative context
window. When it does not, both fields are omitted for that model and Pi applies
its own defaults;
`ocx export` prints how many rows fell into that case.

`maxTokens` is a schema-satisfying budget of `32000`, clamped down to the
context window so a
small-context model is never given more output than context. It is not a claim
about any specific
model's true maximum.

Two fields are deliberately absent. `cost` requires all four price fields and
opencodex has no
price data for routed models — emitting zeros would assert that every model is
free. `reasoning` is
a boolean in Pi while the catalog carries an effort ladder, and mapping one onto
the other would be
a guess.

## Schema status

:::note[Unverified against a real install]
The shape above follows Pi's published custom-provider documentation. It has
**not** been verified
against a real `~/.pi/agent/models.json` on a machine with Pi installed. If Pi
rejects the exported
block, the mismatch is on our side — please
[open an issue](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/issues) with what Pi
reported.
:::

## Requirements

A running opencodex proxy (`ocx start`) and Pi installed. `ocx export` reads the
live catalog
through the proxy's management API, so a config can never be emitted with an
empty model list.
