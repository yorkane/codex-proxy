//! Keeping the runtime alive: what the app does when the runtime it runs goes away unasked.
//!
//! The startup sequence used to be the only thing that ever started a runtime, and it ran at
//! launch and on the failure page's retry. A runtime that exited afterwards — a crash, a terminal
//! `ocx stop`, or a restart the runtime performed itself by handing the port to a detached
//! grandchild this app could not see — was recorded in memory and nothing more. The port kept
//! refusing connections until somebody quit and reopened the app.
//!
//! Two signals start a recovery here, and both only reach the same startup sequence in
//! [`Mode::Recover`], so every gate it has still holds: only a proven absence starts a runtime, a
//! runtime that answers is attached as a guest, and nothing is ever killed or signalled.
//!
//! - The exit of the child this app started ([`on_exit`]). Exit code
//!   [`REQUESTED_RESTART_EXIT_CODE`] is the runtime asking for exactly this: under the marker
//!   `sidecar.rs` sets, a restart (a join into a Child, a memory restart, a disconnect) exits with
//!   it instead of spawning past the app, and the replacement starts almost at once. Any other exit
//!   waits a capped backoff first, so a replacement or a service wrapper that already owns the
//!   port binds before the app looks.
//! - The watchdog ([`watchdog_tick`]), every few seconds while a run is Ready: a different process
//!   answering the endpoint, or several refused connections in a row. It covers a runtime this app
//!   is only a guest on and an exit event that never arrived. Timeouts and unauthorized or
//!   unreadable answers never count; they say something is there.
//!
//! A recovery that finds the port held by a listener this app cannot use (one bound off loopback)
//! is not retried: another attempt would find the same listener, and each one costs a resolve.
//! The supervisor parks instead, and the same watchdog tick asks the endpoint only whether
//! something changed there ([`Parked`]).
//!
//! The tray's Stop, Quit and an update's drain clear the app's wish for a runtime before the
//! runtime's exit can arrive (`exit.rs`), so none of them is ever undone. Every decision is
//! appended to `runtime-supervisor.log` in the app's log directory, bounded, because the exit
//! code otherwise dies with the app.
