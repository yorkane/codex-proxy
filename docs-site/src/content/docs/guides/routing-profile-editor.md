title: Routing Profile Editor
description: Create, edit, validate, dry-run, and remove routing policy profiles from the OpenCodex dashboard.
---

The **Models → Routing** tab in the OpenCodex dashboard can manage `config.routingProfiles` without editing `config.json` by hand.

## Create a profile

1. Open **Routing** in the dashboard.
2. Select **Create profile**.
3. Enter an `id`. The canonical model id is `policy/<id>`.
4. Add one or more explicit provider/model candidates.
5. Configure optional requirements, scoring weights, cost limits (`maxEstimatedCostUsd`, optional `onUnknownCost`), and unknown-evidence behavior.
6. Save the profile.

Profile ids are immutable after creation. To use a different id, create a new profile and remove the old one after updating callers.

## Validation and persistence

The dashboard sends the same profile object used by `config.routingProfiles` to the management API. The server validates the complete candidate before writing it:

- ids and aliases must follow the routing-profile naming and collision rules;
- every candidate provider must exist and be enabled;
- duplicate candidates are rejected;
- numeric limits and requirements must stay inside their supported ranges; and
- at least one optimization weight must be positive.

A successful save persists the profile through the normal config writer, reconciles live state, and refreshes the model catalog. Validation failures leave the previous configuration unchanged and are shown in the editor.

When `limits.maxEstimatedCostUsd` is configured, `limits.onUnknownCost` defaults to `"allow"`: an unknown cost estimate does not get a
cap-specific exclusion, and dry-run / live route-decision traces stamp
`cost.capOutcome: "unknown-allowed"` so operators can tell the cap was not proven. Set `"exclude"`
when the ceiling must fail closed (`cost-limit-unknown`, with
`cost.capOutcome: "unknown-excluded"`). Configuring `onUnknownCost` alone is inert and does not emit a cap outcome. This is separate from
`unknownEvidence.cost`, which can still exclude or penalize unknown prices independently of the
cap outcome.

## Dry-run a saved profile

Candidate capabilities use the effective provider configuration after registry
overrides are applied. Locality requirements (`localOnly` and `remoteAllowed`)
therefore use the effective upstream address. If that address cannot be classified,
the profile's `unknownEvidence.capability` setting decides eligibility.
An invalid provider configuration that cannot be resolved is always excluded with
`route-unavailable`, even when unknown capabilities are allowed.
Missing or disabled providers are also excluded with `route-unavailable` before scoring.

Select a saved profile and use **Dry-run evaluation** to add request evidence such as context-window size, tool use, image input, or structured output. Dry-run evaluates eligibility and scoring but never sends an upstream model request.

Unsaved edits are not used by dry-run. Save the profile first so the displayed revision and evaluation refer to the same configuration.

## Management API

The editor uses these endpoints:

- `GET /api/routing-profiles` lists normalized profiles and revisions.
- `PUT /api/routing-profiles` creates or updates one profile. Send `mode: "create"` or `mode: "update"`; create mode refuses to overwrite an existing id.
- `DELETE /api/routing-profiles?id=<id>` removes one profile.
- `POST /api/routing-profiles/dry-run` evaluates a saved profile without dispatching upstream.

Example save payload:

```json
{
  "id": "fast",
  "mode": "create",
  "profile": {
    "alias": "ocx/fast",
    "candidates": [
      { "provider": "anthropic", "model": "claude-sonnet-5" },
      { "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5.6" }
    ],
    "require": { "tools": true, "minContextWindow": 128000 },
    "optimize": { "latency": 0.55, "health": 0.25, "cost": 0.1, "quota": 0.1 },
    "limits": { "maxEstimatedCostUsd": 0.5, "onUnknownCost": "allow" },
    "unknownEvidence": {
      "capability": "exclude",
      "health": "penalize",
      "quota": "penalize",
      "cost": "penalize"
    }
  }
}
```
