These commands control agent policy and routing, inspect the live proxy, and connect supported clients to opencodex.

## Agent policy

### `ocx agent <status|injection|effort|subagents|fallback|roles|sidecar|memory-models|compaction-routing> ...`

Manage the headless multi-agent roster, effort caps, prompt injection, fallback, and sidecar settings.
Use `status` for the current policy. See [Sub-agent surfaces](/guides/sub-agent-surface/) for how
surface modes, delegation, effort, and fallback behavior fit together.

```bash
ocx agent subagents set ark/model-a,openai/gpt-5.5
```

`ocx agent roles` is for omo (Codex / LazyCodex). It lists each Codex agent role in
`$CODEX_HOME/agents` with its model pin and whether `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` can be updated, or says
LazyCodex is not installed, in which case `set` is refused. `ocx agent roles set <role> <model>` rewrites only
that role's root `model` line and mirrors the value into omo.jsonc at
`codex.agents.<role>.model`. A missing omo.jsonc, or one containing comments, is left unchanged
and the command says so. See [omo (Codex / LazyCodex) role models](/guides/integrations/#omo-codex--lazycodex-role-models).

```bash
ocx agent roles set explorer xai/grok-4.5
```

`ocx agent roles suggest` is omo (Codex / LazyCodex) only, refused like `set` when LazyCodex is not
installed. It sizes every role with one call to the default Codex model (or `--model`) and
prints a proposed model and effort per role without writing anything. `--apply` writes every proposal
through the same write as `set`, skipping and naming the roles whose model and effort already match.
See [Auto-assign](/guides/integrations/#auto-assign).

Human-readable suggestion output displays terminal control characters as visible escapes.
Use `--json` when you need the original suggestion values without presentation escaping.

`ocx agent injection suggest <work>` does the same for the delegation model: it sizes the described
work, proposes the cheapest sufficient model and an effort from the delegation picker's list, and writes
nothing unless `--apply` is given, which saves through the same write as `injection set`. See
[Delegation model and effort](/guides/sub-agent-surface/#delegation-model-and-effort).

`ocx agent sidecar web --list` and `ocx agent sidecar vision --list` print the models the
server currently offers for each sidecar — the exact filtered set the dashboard picker shows
(picker-visible rows plus the login-entitled Luna/Haiku auth slots, intersected with executor
availability for web search, minus provably text-only models for vision). Human-readable lists
show each model's backend in brackets. A web-search `--model` write resolves that server-offered
row and persists its backend and model together, so switching to an Anthropic option cannot keep
an OpenAI backend (or vice versa). Writes go to the same management route as the GUI and are
subject to the same per-sidecar gate: web search refuses a backend/model pair outside the listed
set (closed membership), while vision refuses only a model provably unable to see (unknown ids
stay writable).

```bash
ocx agent sidecar web --list
ocx agent sidecar web --model gpt-5.6-luna
ocx agent sidecar web --enabled off
```

`--enabled off` is the same switch as the Dashboard's Off row: OpenCodex stops running the
sidecar and the Codex integration writes `web_search = "disabled"` into `~/.codex/config.toml`,
which is what lets an MCP search server be the only search path. `--enabled on` removes that
marker-owned line again. When the save actually moves the switch, the command reports the
Codex-side write it triggered (`codexWebSearch` in `--json`, a trailing `Codex config:` line
otherwise) and points at `ocx sync` when it could not happen; a save that leaves the switch
where it was has nothing to report and prints no `Codex config:` line. The flag works for
`vision` too.

### Injection defaults and sidecar runtime settings

```bash
ocx agent injection status --json
ocx agent injection set --sync-codex-defaults off --json
ocx agent injection status --json
ocx agent sidecar web --stream-routed-output on --json
ocx agent sidecar vision --timeout-ms 30000 --json
ocx agent sidecar status --json
```

Run writes only for the requested change. Injection `--sync-codex-defaults on|off`
updates `syncCodexSubagentDefaults`; omitted model/effort/prompt/guidance stay intact,
and `-` clears model/effort/prompt. The receipt has actual normalized
`model`, `effort`, `prompt`, `multiAgentGuidanceEnabled` and
`syncCodexSubagentDefaults`, not a fabricated catalog result.

Web `--reasoning` remains supported. `--max-descriptions` and `--timeout-ms` are
vision-only; timeout accepts integers from 1 to 2147483647 milliseconds.
`--stream-routed-output` is web-only. Partial writes preserve sibling settings.
The new-option receipt exposes only the selected public `webSearch` or `vision`
state and `codexWebSearch` apply report. `{applied:false, reason, retryable}`
distinguishes native apply deferral/refusal from a saved setting; a missing or
mismatched new setting is unverified and nonzero. Read status for full observed
settings, including web reasoning. Do not retry blindly on ownership refusal.

### Memory and compaction routing overrides

```bash
ocx agent memory-models show --json
ocx agent memory-models set --extract-model <route> --extract-effort high --consolidation-model <route> --json
ocx agent memory-models show --json
ocx agent compaction-routing show --json
ocx agent compaction-routing set --model <route> --effort high --triggers manual,auto --sources '<exact-source>,<provider>/*' --json
ocx agent compaction-routing show --json
```

Each set replaces the entire block. Memory accepts extract/consolidation model
and optional effort pairs; an effort without that phase's model is refused.
Omitted phases use their existing/default route, not a stopped pipeline.
`--file memory.json` instead reads the block itself:

```json
{"extract":{"model":"example/model","reasoningEffort":"high"}}
```

An explicit memory file `{}` is valid and remains an empty override block;
`ocx agent memory-models clear --json` writes null. Both mean no custom override,
not disabled memory processing. File mode is exclusive with scalar options.
Regular UTF-8 files or piped `--file -` use the 4 MiB/30-second bounded-input
contract, including a 4 MiB serialized request limit.

Compaction files contain required `model`, optional `reasoningEffort`, `triggers`
and `sourceModels`. Triggers are unique `manual`/`auto`; source selectors must be
exact and unique, or provider/* patterns. Omitted triggers use server defaults;
omitted sources select all sources, not the previous custom scope.
`ocx agent compaction-routing clear --json` writes null and restores ordinary
compaction routing without disabling compaction. No synthetic model call verifies
these saves.

Reads return only `{memoryModels: blockOrNull}` or `{compactionRouting: blockOrNull}`.
Writes add `catalogRefreshPending`: false exits 0 without promising every client
applied, true exits 1 after saving. Missing/malformed pending evidence is null with
`verification:"unverified"` and exit 1. Read back before recovery.

### `ocx effort [status|set|clear]`

Inspect or change main and subagent reasoning-effort caps through the live proxy, or the local
configuration when no proxy is available. Cap values are `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`,
and `ultra`; `-` clears the selected cap. `none` and `minimal` are not cap levels and are rejected
before probing the proxy or submitting an update, including when another option in the same command is valid.
They remain valid for `--injection`, which sets the separate injection effort rather than a cap.

```bash
ocx effort status --json
ocx effort set --main high --subagent low
ocx effort set --subagent -
```

Status preserves existing stored/runtime cap values and reports unsupported values in `warnings`
(an empty array when none are unsupported). The same warnings appear in human output and name the
field that is ignored with a correction command. Status never repairs or rewrites those values.
An ignored subagent field does not remove a valid main cap. `ocx effort clear` clears both caps
while retaining the separate injection-effort setting. See [Sub-agent surfaces](/guides/sub-agent-surface/)
for the request surfaces where caps apply.

### `ocx v2 <status|on|off|mode <v1|default|v2>|keep-native-v1 <on|off>|threads <n>|mode-hint <text|--clear>>`

Manage the Codex `multi_agent_v2` feature flag and the three-state multi-agent surface mode.
These operate locally by default. `--live` uses the selected running proxy with no
local fallback; both targets support `--json`. Re-read status on the same target
after a change and distinguish stored settings from new-session behavior.

| Subcommand | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `status` (default) | Report the current v2 flag, multi-agent mode, and thread concurrency. |
| `on` | Enable the global `multi_agent_v2` feature; local changes resync the catalog. Rejected while the v2 hybrid pin is active because the global override would defeat it. |
| `off` | Disable the `multi_agent_v2` feature and resync the catalog. |
| `mode v1` | Force all models to v1, disable native v2, and preserve the active thread limit. |
| `mode default` | Respect upstream model surface pins. |
| `mode v2` | Force models to v2 and preserve the active thread limit. With `keep-native-v1` off, enable global native v2; with it on, disable the global override and use catalog pins. |
| `keep-native-v1 on\|off` | Under `mode v2`, keep ChatGPT-native models on v1 and routed models on v2. Enabling it disables the global V2 override before catalog sync. |
| `threads <n>` | Set the active v1/v2 thread limit to an integer of at least 1. |
| `mode-hint <text>` | Set the Proactive delegation hint (Ultra mode) for every model and effort. |
| `mode-hint --clear` | Remove the hint so the effort-derived policy (ultra = proactive) resumes. |

```bash
ocx v2 status
ocx v2 mode v1
ocx v2 mode default
ocx v2 on
ocx v2 threads 16
ocx v2 mode-hint "Proactive multi-agent delegation is active."
ocx v2 mode-hint --clear
```

The `mode` subcommand writes `multiAgentMode` to the opencodex config and resyncs the Codex catalog.
Mode and flag transitions move the current numeric thread limit between the valid v1/v2 Codex keys;
a failed transition restores the original `config.toml`. Changes apply to new Codex sessions, while
running sessions keep their pinned surface.

Codex resolves an enabled global `multi_agent_v2` override before the selected model's catalog
pin. The hybrid `keep-native-v1` contract therefore keeps that global override off; otherwise a
native row stamped `v1` would still start on V2 and produce backend-encrypted child tasks.

`mode-hint` writes `features.multi_agent_v2.multi_agent_mode_hint_text` in Codex's
`$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` even when `multi_agent_v2` is currently disabled. The
command only persists the override; it does not enable or disable the feature, so
the hint takes effect when a matching Codex surface is active. The hint overrides
codex-rs's effort-derived multi-agent policy, so any model and any reasoning effort
receives the Proactive delegation prompt. It does **not** change reasoning effort
itself. A missing argument or a whitespace-only value is rejected; only `--clear`
removes the hint. The Subagents dashboard's Ultra mode **on** toggle has a stricter
gate: it requires the native feature to be enabled with an explicit v2 surface
(`ocx v2 mode v2`); `ocx v2 on` alone does not satisfy that dashboard gate.

#### Explicit v2 target and outcome

```bash
ocx v2 status --json
ocx v2 status --live --json
ocx v2 mode v1 --live --json
ocx v2 status --live --json
```

The live write uses the existing management route. Only explicit live `mode`
accepts `--acknowledge-surface-advisory`; add it only when acknowledging that
advisory is requested. Local mode and status/on/off/keep-native/threads/hint reject
it. There is no automatic acknowledgment.

For literal reserved hint text, pass one quoted operand after `--`:

```bash
ocx v2 mode-hint --live --json -- '--clear'
```

This stores literal `--clear`; without `--`, `mode-hint --clear` removes the hint.
The suffix is not scanned for help, live, JSON or clear controls; controls belong
before `--`. Extra operands and duplicate flags refuse before mutation.

Local JSON is `{ok, target:"local", action, changed, state, sync}` using actual
post-write state. Mode/keep-native and changed on/off keep their real sync attempt
even without a discovered port; threads/hints and unchanged on/off add no sync.
An absent/malformed sync result becomes unverified with exit 1, not success.
`changed` or state can be unknown after failure; do not claim rollback.
Live status reports validated state/advisory/recommendation with `target:"live"`;
writes add `ok:true` and `catalogRefresh`. Only committed, nondegraded refresh exits
0. HTTP 502 may mean partially applied native state: inspect before retrying.
Local usage errors retain exit 1; new live usage errors use exit 2.

## Combo routing

### `ocx combo <list|show|set|remove|stats> ...` · `ocx route combo ...`

Manage combo failover and round-robin virtual models. `ocx route combo` is the hierarchical alias;
combos and routing profiles are distinct resources. Combo targets use
`provider/model[:weight],provider/model[:weight]`.

```bash
ocx combo list
ocx route combo set reliable --targets ark/model-a:2,openai/gpt-5.5
```

`set` accepts `--strategy`, `--sticky`, `--effort`, `--alias`, `--rename-from`, `--native-alias`, and
`--display-name <label|->` (`-` clears the label). A native alias captures only one currently supported,
unqualified bare OpenAI model id. Bare `gpt-5.6-*` native aliases use Codex Pool/Direct credentials.
Account-qualified OpenAI routes remain distinct, while provider-qualified routes such as
`openai-apikey/gpt-5.6-*` use their configured API key and never fall through to the native alias.
Read the safety and visibility contract in the guide before enabling the compatibility pair.
With `--strategy jev` only, the decision method is chosen by one of two mutually exclusive flags.
`--decision-provider <provider|->` names a configured `jev-decision` row (for example a self-hosted
Ollama `tev1`) as a System One-compatible server. `--decision-model <route|->` names an ordinary
opencodex route (for example `ollama/qwen3:4b`) that answers the same choice as JSON; it cannot be
this combo or any JEV combo. Omitting both uses TypeSafe. `--decision-timeout <ms|->` sets the
decision deadline (1000–120000, default 4000); `-` clears any of the three.

`ocx combo test [--combo <id>] [--decision-provider <provider|jev> | --decision-model <route>]
[--decision-timeout <ms>]` sends one synthetic decision probe through a saved combo's method or an
unsaved selection and reports the gate, backend, and latency; it may spend one decision call.
`ocx combo discover [--query <text>]` lists configured System One rows and catalog models that look
like decision models, with the derived endpoint.

For structured target metadata, inspect offline help and the current combo:

```bash
ocx combo set --help
ocx combo list --json
ocx combo show reliable --json
```

A `--targets-file` document is a nonempty ordered array, for example this shape
with provider/model values replaced by actual configured candidates:

```json
[{"provider":"example","model":"raw/model","weight":1,"reasoningEfforts":["high"],"modelProfile":"Reasoning tasks","lastResort":false}]
```

Optional fields are `weight`, `reasoningEfforts`, `modelProfile` and `lastResort`.
Efforts are a unique nonempty list of `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, `ultra`;
empty/none/minimal custom-model semantics do not apply. Files or explicit piped
`-` have a 4 MiB limit and 30-second read deadline; the serialized management body
must also fit 4 MiB. Unknown fields refuse before the write.

```bash
ocx combo set reliable --targets-file targets.json --image-input auto --reasoning-effort-mode strict --json
ocx combo show reliable --json
```

`--targets-file` and `--targets` are mutually exclusive. Omitting both preserves
complete target metadata for partial edits; replacement files preserve order and
explicit `lastResort: false`. `--image-input auto|disabled` and
`--reasoning-effort-mode strict|adaptive` preserve omission, while explicit `auto`
and `strict` override saved disabled/adaptive values. Reasoning-effort mode is
separate from `--effort-mode fallback|force`, which governs the default effort.
`--native-alias on|off` preserves explicit false; the legacy bare flag means true.
Turning it off may require the intended alias clear, `--native-alias off --alias -`,
to avoid retaining an incompatible native alias. Set/rename is an upsert without
CAS, so re-read after changes. The receipt is `{success, id, model, combo, catalogRefresh}`;
skipped, failed or degraded catalog refresh returns nonzero after saving.

### Observe combo decision statistics

```bash
ocx combo stats reliable --range 30d --json
```

Use the exact stored combo ID from list/show, not its public model or alias.
Ranges are `7d`, `30d` (default), and `all`. This reads recorded JEV observations
without running a paid decision probe. Inspect decisions, model attempts,
measured attempts, model tokens and decision tokens separately. Keep the
`measuredModelAttempts/modelAttempts` and `decisionUsageReported/decisions`
coverage ratios with the totals. Nullable averages are unavailable, not zero.
Preserve `usageIncomplete`, `historyTruncated`, `entriesTruncated`, dropped-entry
counts and snapshot-window boundaries. Zero observations do not prove success.
There is no monetary cost or comparative savings field in this report.

See [Combos](/guides/combos/) for routing behavior and configuration guidance.

## Routing profiles

Existing profiles support inspection and evaluation through the live API:

```bash
ocx route policy list --json
ocx route policy show reliable --json
ocx route policy dry-run reliable --model-context 128000 --tools --image --structured-output --json
```

Only run this evaluation with authority to activate Lab on the target. The management POST can activate Lab and start automation that is already enabled there, including upstream probes. Use list/show for observation without that activation effect.

Replace `reliable` with a listed ID. `evaluate` is an alias for `dry-run`; both
send requirements to the saved profile's evaluator without an inference request.
Creation, update and deletion use the explicit file/revision workflow below.
Combo writes edit a separate resource. Missing profiles return exit 4 and missing
operands return 2.

### Edit a routing profile with its observed revision

Create/update can activate Lab and already-enabled automation, including upstream
probes. Only run them with that authority. List/show are observational; first
read offline help and save the intended profile:

```bash
ocx route policy update --help
ocx route policy show reliable --json > profile.observed.json
jq 'del(.id, .model, .revision) | if .alias == null then del(.alias) else . end' profile.observed.json > profile.next.json
```

Edit and review the next file; keep the observed file unchanged. Input contains
only editable `alias`, `candidates`, `require`, `optimize`, `limits`,
`unknownEvidence`, and `compatibility` with supported nested fields. `id`, `model`,
`revision`, unknown keys and null alias are not editable input. The server still
validates provider, alias and policy semantics. `--file -` accepts piped stdin;
regular UTF-8 files/stdin have the 4 MiB and 30-second bounded read contract.

```bash
ocx route policy update reliable --file profile.next.json --expected-revision '<exact-revision-from-observed-show>' --json
ocx route policy show reliable --json
```

Use the original opaque revision explicitly. HTTP 409 / exit 5 means read show
again, review concurrent changes and rebuild the edit. Never silently fetch a
replacement revision, retry or convert update into create. For an authorized new
ID use `ocx route policy create <new-id> --file profile.next.json --json` without a
revision. Authorized removal is `ocx route policy remove <id> --yes --json` and
has no revision guard.

Create/update returns `{success, id, model, profile, catalogRefresh}` with the new
`profile.revision`; remove returns `{success, id, catalogRefresh}`. Only committed,
nondegraded refresh exits 0. A saved receipt with skipped/failed/degraded refresh
exits 1: inspect before recovery instead of repeating the configuration write.

## Compatibility Lab

Lab is local inspection **and** explicit evidence/automation management. Reads
use the local projection and do not require a running management API:

```bash
ocx lab status --json
ocx lab catalog --json
ocx lab subjects --limit 10 --json
ocx lab automation status --json
ocx lab automation runs --limit 10 --json
ocx lab public community --json
```

`subject`, `observations`, `event`, `artifact`, and `production-signals` follow
local evidence lineage. The public family offers preview/export by repeated
`--event <id>`, verification/import through `--file <bundle.json>`, and community
context. Export and import write local evidence. Verification can print its
result and still exit nonzero when the bundle is not cryptographically valid.

Automation enable/disable changes local policy; manual `lab run` selects a layer
and scenario and may spend upstream quota. Read `ocx help lab` and the relevant
leaf before these authorized operations. A saved local policy does not prove
that a separately running proxy's scheduler adopted it. Full automation policy
editing and run cancellation are not exposed by these CLI controls.

## Observability and debug

### `ocx observe <logs|usage|storage|memory|debug|claude-inbound|injection> ...`

Inspect proxy requests, usage, storage, memory, and debug data. The direct aliases are:

| Alias | Equivalent resource |
| --- | --- |
| `ocx logs [filters] [--follow] [--json|--jsonl|--events]` | `ocx observe logs` |
| `ocx usage [--range <today|1d|7d|30d|all>] [--since <timestamp> --until <timestamp>] [--surface <all|codex|claude|grok>] [--provider <name>] [--model <id>] [--api-key-id <id>] [--json]` | `ocx observe usage` |
| `ocx storage [--json]` | `ocx observe storage` |
| `ocx memory [--json]` | `ocx observe memory` |

```bash
ocx observe usage --range 30d --json
ocx usage --since 2026-09-01T09:00:00Z --until 2026-09-01T10:59:59.999Z --json
```

`--since` and `--until` must be supplied together. They accept integer epoch milliseconds or
full ISO datetimes with an explicit timezone, include both endpoints, and override `--range`.
Invalid or reversed bounds fail before the request. Human output prints the requested interval;
`--json` includes `customWindow`, `since`, and `until`. Existing surface/provider/model filters
still apply. These commands query the running proxy; they do not provide offline reports.

`--range today` (alias `1d`) reports the current local day. `--provider` and
`--model` narrow the report to one upstream target — distinct from
`--surface`, which selects the calling client (Codex, Claude Code, Grok)
rather than the provider serving the request.

The default view prints request, token and estimated-cost totals plus
per-provider and per-model breakdowns. Costs are API list-price equivalents,
not a billing receipt: subscription plans and provider credits are billed
separately, and requests with no matching price row are counted as
`unpriced`/`unmetered` rather than folded in as zero.

```bash
ocx usage --range today --provider xai
```

When some usage records cannot be included, human output warns, including when there are zero readable rows.
Any displayed totals reflect readable records only. If a filter has no readable matches, the output shows
the warning and guidance instead of total lines; skipped records may contain matches.
`--json` preserves the response-level `usageIncomplete` diagnostic and reason.

### Filter a bounded log snapshot

```bash
ocx logs filter --surface claude --status errors --time-window 1h --scan-limit 2000 --limit 50 --json
```

`ocx observe logs filter` is the equivalent family form. This reads one recent
window, filters locally, then keeps the newest matches in their original order.
`--scan-limit` controls fetched rows (1–2000, default 2000); `--limit` controls
returned rows (1–2000, default 200). JSON reports
`{schemaVersion:1,logs,cursor,filters,window:{scanLimit,loaded,matched,returned,limit}}`.
Counts describe this observed window, not all history. JSONL emits rows only;
empty matches succeed. Cursor metadata is not a resumable search token.

Selectors include `--surface all|codex|claude|grok`, `--status all|success|errors`,
`--time-window all|15m|1h|24h`, `--model`, `--provider`, `--conversation`
(alias `--conversationId`), `--intercepted-only`, `--min-tok-per-sec`,
`--max-tok-per-sec`, and `--protocol-mode all|native|translated|legacy-bridge|blocked|none`.
Model/provider equality is trimmed and case-insensitive, including
resolved/served models and attempts. Claude includes Desktop; Codex means absent
surface. Success is HTTP 200–299, errors 400–599. Time lower bounds are inclusive.
Speed uses observed value-kind tok/s, with inclusive minimum and exclusive
maximum; unavailable values fail active speed filters. Protocol none includes
absent or invalid traces. Conversation matching uses the same hash-aware IDs as
ordinary logs. Interception selects string-valued rewrite markers.

Unknown/repeated/conflicting flags, invalid bounds, and follow/events fail before
discovery. Malformed, oversized or failed reads are nonzero, not empty results.
To reduce response size, reduce the scan limit; reducing output limit does not
change the fetch. For streaming use the separate follow forms below.

### Search usage model rows

```bash
ocx usage --range 7d --search 'model-a' --json
```

`--search` matches a trimmed case-insensitive substring in model, provider or
resolved model after reading the report. It sorts model rows by descending total
tokens with stable ties and keeps up to 100. JSON adds
`modelView:{query,matchedModelCount,returnedModelCount,limit:100,truncated}`;
human output labels the view and shows its selected model rows. Report totals,
provider/day/account rows, exact filters and incomplete/window metadata remain
unchanged. No model match does not mean no report usage.

An explicit blank query (`--search=`) selects the top-100 view; omitting search
preserves the existing output. Exact `--provider`/`--model` still scope the
underlying report. Search does not broaden selected-key or connected-client
self scope and is never sent as a new Hub API query parameter.

### Saved companion usage totals

```bash
ocx companion show --json
ocx companion usage --json
```

The second command reads saved companion settings, then today and 30d usage
sequentially on the same management runtime. It applies the saved `models` and
`hiddenProviders` preferences and preserves unknown/unmeasured costs and tokens.
Null model selection means all; an empty selection means none. It does not
change settings, operate native windows or relay through a connected client.

JSON returns `schemaVersion:1`, `filters`, `settingsUpdatedAt`,
`settingsCorrupt`, `settingsFallback`, `ranges` and `partial`. Each range has
`status:"available"` with filtered `data`, or `status:"unavailable"`.
An unavailable range sets partial and exit 1 while retaining the other range.
Available incomplete data retains its own metadata; it is not measured zero.
Valid server defaults retain a null settings timestamp and set fallback;
corrupt-file defaults additionally set corrupt and warn in human output.
Malformed settings stop before usage reads. These reads are not an atomic
snapshot. Each GET has a 10-second fetch/body deadline after discovery and a
32 MiB response cap; this is not a whole-command deadline. Signals exit 130/143
without late results.

### Follow request windows or injection sequences

```bash
ocx logs --help
ocx logs --limit 200 --json
ocx logs --follow --events --limit 200
```

`--events` requires follow and implies JSONL; redundant `--jsonl` is accepted.
`--json` remains one-shot and conflicts with follow/events. Each events-v1 line
is `{schemaVersion:1,type:"snapshot"|"append",rows,cursor,limit}`. Replace the
consumer window on snapshot, append/trim on append, preserving order and repeated
IDs. Initial empty and reset/removal snapshots are emitted; stable empty polls
remain silent. Legacy arrays are snapshots with cursor null, not invented cursors.
These are observed windows, not a lossless replay of traffic missed between polls
or after ring eviction.

`ocx logs --follow --jsonl --limit 200` retains row-shaped output. It re-emits changed
occurrences, including same-ID status/token amendments and repeated IDs. Do not
collapse everything by request ID. This legacy output cannot encode removals,
resets or exact window order; choose events when those distinctions matter.
Log follow limit is 1–2000, default 200.

```bash
ocx observe injection --limit 500 --json
ocx observe injection --follow --jsonl --limit 500
```

Injection emits ordered `{seq,at,line}` rows, where `at` is epoch milliseconds;
internal `after` advances with seq. Follow limit is 1–2000, default 500. JSON is
one-shot and JSONL requires follow. Observation does not enable capture. Empty
polls do not identify disabled capture or prove absence of gaps. Detectable runtime
drift stops; undetectable restart/latest-N gaps cannot be excluded without an API
epoch/gap marker.

Both follow loops use serial one-second waits, 10-second fetch/body deadlines and
32 MiB response limits. Malformed/oversized/transport errors stop with stderr and
exit 1, without automatic retry/reconnect. Reduce limit for oversized windows.
SIGINT/Ctrl-C exits 130, SIGTERM 143, with no later polls/output. Inspect exit state
and retained rows instead of treating cancellation as complete history.

### Companion timeline and key-scoped usage

```bash
ocx companion timeline --help
ocx companion timeline --hours 24 --bucket-minutes 60 --metric total --aggregation sum --grouping model --model example/model-a --hide-provider excluded-provider --json
```

Replace fictional IDs with the selected filters. Repeat `--model` for individual
provider/model IDs (nested slashes allowed; not CSV); repeat `--hide-provider` to
exclude providers. Positive `--provider` is unsupported. Hours are 6/24/72/168,
bucket minutes 1–1440 with at most 2000 buckets, metric total/input/output/cached,
aggregation sum/average/max, grouping model/modelAccount. The API limits filter
inputs to 100 items. This reads usage without changing companion settings.

Check `appliedFilters.models/hiddenProviders`. Timeline bounds are epoch seconds,
with exclusive end, unlike ordinary usage's millisecond custom window. The end must
match the request-time bucket, or its immediate successor if the request crosses
a bucket boundary; an older aligned window is refused. Empty
series retains bucket/filter metadata. `missingMeasurements` and `truncated` must
remain visible: zero-filled points do not prove complete zero usage.

On a non-client management host:

```bash
ocx access key list --json
ocx usage --api-key-id key-example --range 7d --json
```

Use a non-secret actual key ID. The CLI requires exact response acknowledgment in
`filter.apiKeyId`; ignored filters fail rather than showing unscoped totals.
An unknown acknowledged ID can return `matched:false` and empty traffic, not 404.
Keep incomplete/custom-window facts. Connected clients reject `--api-key-id`
before enrolled-key access or transport; omit it for existing self-only Hub usage
or perform the selected-key view on the Hub. No data key grants management authority.

### `ocx debug <provider|usage|injection|claude> <on|off|status|reset|logs [-f]>`

Read or change runtime debug overrides through the running proxy's management API.

```bash
ocx debug provider on|off|status|reset
ocx debug provider logs [-f|--follow]
ocx debug usage on|off|status|reset
ocx debug usage logs [-f|--follow]
```

With no scope, `ocx debug` prints usage and, when the proxy is stopped, the next-start environment
defaults. Provider debug defaults from `OCX_DEBUG=1` (legacy `OCX_DEBUG_FRAMES=1` also works); usage
debug defaults from `OPENCODEX_USAGE_DEBUG=1`.

## API access

### `ocx access <key|endpoints|models|test|audio> ...`

Inspect admission keys, external endpoints and models with the access family.
`ocx api-key` aliases the access-key family. Creation and rotation-start return a
one-time plaintext credential in text and JSON output. Agents must leave those
steps to a human-operated terminal outside the agent session; request only
confirmation and non-secret key/rotation IDs, never the credential.

```bash
ocx access key list --json
```

After the human configures and verifies the replacement, committing its rotation
or removing the old key requires separate explicit revocation authority. Safe
non-secret follow-ups are `ocx access key rotate commit <id> <rotation-id> --json`
and `ocx access key rotate abort <id> <rotation-id> --json`, with authority for
the chosen action. Re-list afterward. Missing pending state alone does not prove
commit: expiry or abort can also clear it. Do not route around consent by issuing
the secret-returning management request directly.

### Rename one key without changing its access policy

```bash
ocx access key rename key-example 'Research client' --json
ocx access key list --json
```

Use an actual unique ID or unambiguous name. Rename sends only `{id,name}` and
preserves provider/model scopes; it does not rotate/delete a key. The response
contains id/name/createdAt and optional allowedProviders/allowedModels, never
plaintext or a prefix. List remains masked. Names are control-free, trimmed,
nonempty and at most 64 JavaScript string units. The read/rename sequence is not
CAS; inspect the masked roster after an unknown outcome before retrying. The
root `api-key rename` alias uses the same command.

### Explicit-key model and audio checks

Discover the installed syntax without contacting upstream:

```bash
ocx access test --help
ocx access audio transcribe --help
ocx access audio live-check --help
```

Model requests, audio uploads and live-session checks require explicit operator
authorization for that particular upstream operation and possible quota/cost.
The operator supplies the selected key from an approved private stdin source in
a human-operated terminal outside the agent session. Agents must not capture it
or ask for it in chat. Never put it in argv/environment. These are the ocx side
of that private pipe, not direct interactive key prompts or an agent-run batch:

```bash
ocx access test example/model --protocol responses --api-key-stdin --json
ocx access audio transcribe sample.wav --model gpt-4o-mini-transcribe --api-key-stdin --json
ocx access audio live-check --model gpt-live-1-codex --api-key-stdin --json
```

Choose only the authorized task and real model/file. TTY input is refused. Input
is bounded to 4096 bytes/30 seconds, valid UTF-8 printable ASCII, without outer
whitespace, controls or extra lines; one final LF/CRLF is allowed. This deliberately
covers currently issued keys, not every Unicode value the server configuration
might accept. Exact supplied-key occurrences in permitted text become `[redacted]`;
arbitrary encodings are not guaranteed detected. No encoded key carrier is printed.

Targets are the checked local serving origin or existing normalized enrolled Hub
origin, with identity checked around asynchronous work. There is no custom-origin,
admin or enrolled-key fallback, redirect following, credential cache or automatic
retry. The operator reports only the non-secret result to the agent.

#### Model control and response limits

Protocols are chat (default), responses or messages. Selected-key mode first
sends one credentialless malformed-JSON control to that endpoint. Only the native
key-required 401 advances to one fixed 16-token model request using the supplied
key. The control has a 5-second/4096-byte response budget; the request has a
60-second/2 MiB response budget including body reads. Authless/unrecognized
controls stop before inference. Local logging/admission bookkeeping may still occur.

JSON is `{schemaVersion:1,control:{outcome,status?},request:{outcome,status?},response?}`.
Safe response contains protocol, ordered text, complete/limited completion and
optional measured token counts. A usable length-limited reply is `limited`;
refusal/content-filter/tool-only or malformed responses are unsupported, even
with HTTP 2xx. Error metadata, IDs, tools and reasoning are not printed.
Operational failure retains one versioned report plus fixed stderr/exit 1;
invalid grammar/key input exits 2 without a fabricated report.

Success says only: “Credentialless request was refused; the model request using
the supplied key succeeded.” Listener/policy changes between calls remain possible;
this does not certify key scope, atomic admission or billing identity. Without
`--api-key-stdin`, legacy test JSON remains its original payload and says nothing
about a newly selected key.

#### Transcription and live readiness

Transcription requires a nonempty regular file of at most 25,000,000 bytes with a
30-second local read limit, and a multipart body capped at 32 MiB. Models are
gpt-4o-transcribe, gpt-4o-mini-transcribe or whisper-1, subject to target support.
Upload/response share 130 seconds; response is capped at 2 MiB. Success returns
only `{text}`, including empty text, with exact-key redaction. Failure leaves
stdout empty and prints fixed stderr/nonzero; no JSON error envelope or raw body.

Audio uses explicit-key admission without the model control. Live-check sends
fixed session.update and session.close only. Readiness requires session.started
or session.updated with nonblank native session ID within 15 seconds; socket-open
or session.created alone is insufficient. After readiness it waits at most 2
seconds for normal code-1000 closure. Each UTF-8 frame is capped at 64 KiB, aggregate
2 MiB; there is no retained frame history.

Live JSON is `{schemaVersion:1,ready,close:"confirmed"|"unverified",check:"session-readiness",event?}`.
Operational failure preserves that observation without raw frames. Partial readiness
with unverified close exits 1; a later normal close cannot erase an earlier error.
Signals exit 130/143. This checks readiness/closure only, not microphone, upload,
tool execution, full voice roundtrip or server lease release. Opening the upstream
session is not guaranteed free. No reconnect or retry is automatic.

### `ocx api <protocols|explain|policy> ...`

Inspect and set how requests travel between the client APIs and provider wires. See
[Protocol paths](/guides/protocol-paths/) for the vocabulary.

| Command | Route | Changes state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ocx api protocols [--provider <name>] [--json]` | `GET /api/protocols` | No |
| `ocx api explain --model <id> --inbound <responses\|chat\|messages> [--feature <key>]... [--json]` | `POST /api/protocols/plan` | No |
| `ocx api policy [--json]` | `GET /api/protocols` | No |
| `ocx api policy [--messages <on\|off>] [--unrepresentable <legacy\|reject>] [--rollout <switch>=<on\|off>]... [--json]` | `PATCH /api/protocols/settings` | Yes |

- `protocols` prints the contract version, whether each client API is served and why, the
  unrepresentable policy, every rollout switch, and the policy revision. `--provider` adds the
  upstream wire that provider receives, who decided it, and the models on another wire.
- `explain` previews the path a model would take from one client API. `--feature` is repeatable
  and accepts a comma-separated list; `ocx api protocols --json` lists the known feature keys. The
  preview is computed from configuration: nothing is sent upstream, no combo rotation advances, and
  the input is not logged.
- `policy` without a setting flag only reads. With one it sends a single change to the running
  proxy, which validates it, saves the configuration, and answers with the new policy.
  `--messages off` also turns the Claude integration off, as the dashboard toggle does. Switch
  names and combinations are validated by the proxy; for example
  `--rollout managedMessagesNativeOAuth=on` is refused unless `managedMessagesNative` is
  already on or turned on in the same command.

```bash
ocx api explain --model combo/main --inbound chat --feature request.seed,request.tools
ocx api policy --rollout shadowPlan=on
```

Usage errors exit 2 before any request is sent. `--json` prints the management API body as is.

## Client integrations

### Basic integration commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `ocx integration client status [--client <id>] [--profile <id>] [--json]` | Read all managed file integrations, one client, or Aside profiles. `show` and `list` alias `status`. |
| `ocx integration client history [--client <id>] [--profile <id>] [--json]` | Read rollback operations and snapshot availability. `journal` aliases `history`. |
| `ocx integration client enable --client <id> [--profile <id>] [--overwrite-conflict] [--json]` | Apply the managed file integration. Overwriting a conflicting block requires the explicit flag. |
| `ocx integration client disable --client <id> [--profile <id>] [--json]` | Remove the selected managed integration through its runtime owner. |
| `ocx integration client restore --op <opId> [--client aside --profile <id>] [--confirm-drift] [--json]` | Restore a recorded operation; replacing later edits requires explicit drift confirmation. |
| `ocx integration native [list] [--json]` | Read native integration state. |
| `ocx integration native <claude\|claude-desktop\|codex\|grok> <on\|off> [--json]` | Write the selected native client's configuration through its runtime owner. |

These commands require a running proxy. `--profile` selects a nonnegative Aside account ID and
requires `--client aside`; omitted profiles select the aggregate for reads and all profiles for
unbound enable/disable. Native toggles change client configuration; Cursor has separate read-only
inspection commands below. For preview and bound-write options, continue with the recipes below.

### Preview and recover managed file integrations

```bash
ocx integration client preview --client hermes --operation apply --json
ocx integration client restore --op op-example --preview --json
```

`op-example` is fictional; use an ID from history. Preview operations are apply,
overwrite and disable; restore uses `--preview` on its existing command. Review
structural changes and `canApply`/`willChange`; valid refusal/no-op exits 0 without
applying. Enable/disable/restore accept optional `--plan-fingerprint` for an
explicit bound commit. Direct legacy writes remain available. Aside preview or
bound writes require `--client aside --profile N`. Drift confirmation and overwrite
are never automatic; stale binding exits 5 with empty stdout and a re-preview
instruction on stderr. Follow the [complete preview/commit and drift recipes](/guides/integrations/#preview-and-bind-a-terminal-write).

Droid apply/overwrite supports repeated `--reasoning-default MODEL=EFFORT` for
full map replacement, or exclusive `--clear-reasoning-defaults` for `{}`. Omission
preserves the map. Repeat the exact map in preview and commit; see
[Droid defaults](/guides/integrations/#factory-droid).

History removal is irreversible and requires an exact opId plus `--yes`:
`ocx integration client history remove --op op-example --yes --json` addresses the
global journal. Only `--client aside` and optional `--profile N` provide narrower
delete scopes. The newest row is protected. `snapshotRemoved:false` exits 1 after
retirement with cleanup incomplete; do not retry deletion or claim rollback.

`ocx integration client sync --client aside --json` refreshes eligible profiles
through the attested owner, with no profile selector or local fallback. Empty
`results` is successful observation of no eligible profiles; a failed row makes
the aggregate nonzero while preserving other successes. Read status and recovery
facts before retrying; [Aside controls](/guides/integrations/#aside-profile-controls)
explain profile intent versus file state.

### Inspect Cursor without installing it

```bash
ocx integration native cursor status --json
ocx integration native cursor local-installer --json
```

Status can gather model inventory; installer lookup may fetch a public manifest.
They do not download/install or toggle Cursor. Status distinguishes credential
from placeholder gateway mode; the placeholder is not an access credential.
Installer `{available:false,url:null,version:null,reason:null}` is valid, including
when Private Inference is already installed. A valid unavailable read exits 0.

### `ocx integration <claude|grok> ...`

Manage supported Claude and Grok integrations. The direct command families below expose their
client-specific controls.

### `ocx claude [claude args...]`

Ensure the proxy is running, then launch Claude Code with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1`, and model slots from
`config.claudeCode`. Routed models appear in the native `/model` picker through stable slot aliases
with Claude Code 2.1.129 or newer. On older versions, select with `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` or `/model <id>`.
User-exported `ANTHROPIC_*` variables always take precedence.

Claude Desktop profile commands are:

```text
ocx claude desktop [apply]                         Save and apply the four-family profile
ocx claude desktop show [--json]                   Show routes, families, and defaults
ocx claude desktop status [--json]                 Show applied state, drift, and health
ocx claude desktop move <route> <family> [--default]
ocx claude desktop default <family> <route|none>
ocx claude desktop export <path|->                 Export versioned JSON (`-` = stdout)
ocx claude desktop import <path> [--apply]         Validate and import JSON
```

The families are `opus`, `fable`, `sonnet`, and `haiku`; new routes start in `opus`. `none` is valid
only when that family is empty. Legacy apply flags `--static`, `--hybrid`, and `--discovery-only`
remain supported. Use `ocx claude config <status|set> ...` for Claude Code settings.

#### Read or save the selected runtime's Desktop profile

The existing show/import commands above are local. The `profile` family targets
the running management runtime and can gather model inventory:

```bash
ocx claude desktop profile show --json > desktop-observed.json
jq '.profile' desktop-observed.json > desktop-profile.json
```

Edit/review the versioned profile, preserving server-owned applied markers. For
an authorized save, then read-back:

```bash
ocx claude desktop profile import desktop-profile.json --json
ocx claude desktop profile show --json
```

Import accepts the profile itself, not the outer `{profile,models,rendered,port}`
response, using bounded regular JSON files or explicit stdin `-` (4 MiB/30 seconds).
It returns those observed fields plus `ok:true`, meaning saved only. `--apply` and
native-mode flags are rejected; failed runtime save has no local fallback. Apply
is a separate existing Desktop action on its machine, so verify host/context
before choosing it. Rendered models are not proof of native application.

### `ocx opencode [opencode args...]`

Ensure the proxy is running, then launch opencode with the generated `provider.opencodex` and
`providers.opencodex` blocks in OpenCode's inline runtime layer (`OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`). The
legacy block keeps V1 clients working with variant maps; the V2 block carries native arrays
for the same reasoning-effort choices and defaults. Existing inline config is preserved and only those two keys are replaced
for this launch. Global or project `opencode.json` files may be read to warn about an existing
override, but on-disk files are never modified. Routed models appear as
`opencodex/<provider>/<model>`. Launching plain `opencode` later behaves exactly as before.

### `ocx grok <status|exclude|include|set|clear|apply> ...`

Manage and apply the Grok Build model fence.

## Client config export

### `ocx export --client <opencode|pi|omp|hermes|openclaw|kimi|gajae|dsh|mcode|zcode|prime|aside|raycast|omo|cline|kilo|droid>`

Print a client config wired to the running proxy. The command serializes the
`opencodex` provider block — base URL, model list, and the client's credential
reference or loopback placeholder — in the selected client's native format.

The proxy must be running; the command resolves its live port, reads `/api/models`, and emits only
models Codex can currently see.

OpenCode and Kilo exports preserve effective model limits, known capabilities, declared reasoning
choices and defaults, including metadata inherited by custom rows. Explicit overrides still win;
unknown capabilities and defaults are not invented. The OpenCode launcher uses the same metadata.
See [client integrations](/guides/integrations/) for managed refresh and upgrade behavior.

| Flag | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `--client <opencode\|pi\|omp\|hermes\|openclaw\|kimi\|gajae\|dsh\|mcode\|zcode\|prime\|aside\|raycast\|omo\|cline\|kilo\|droid>` | Required. Selects the client config dialect. |
| `--json` | Print the generated document as JSON on stdout for scripts. This is JSON even when the selected client's native format is YAML, TOML, or JSON5. |
| `--out <path>` | Write the client's native config format to `<path>`. Refuses to replace an existing file. |
| `--force` | Allow `--out` to replace an existing file. |

```bash
ocx export --client opencode                     # config plus destination, merge warning, and counts
ocx export --client pi --json > pi-models.json   # JSON document for a pipe or a diff
ocx export --client omp --out ./omp-models.yml    # native OMP YAML
ocx export --client opencode --out ~/opencodex-opencode.json
```

Without `--json` the generated config leads, then the canonical destination path, the merge warning, the env
export line where the client has one, and a model count with how many rows omit context limits (the
client applies its own defaults for those).

| Client | Canonical destination | Download filename | Env var |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `opencode` | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` wins when set) | `opencode.json` | `OPENCODEX_OPENCODE_API_KEY` |
| `pi` | `~/.pi/agent/models.json` (`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` wins when set; a relative value is refused) | `pi-models.json` | none — the block carries the literal `opencodex-loopback` |
| `omp` | `~/.omp/agent/models.yml` (`OMP_PROFILE` wins over `PI_PROFILE`, even when empty; named profiles use the home-relative `PI_CONFIG_DIR` directory name and ignore `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, while the default profile lets `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` win) | `omp-models.yaml` | none — loopback placeholder |
| `hermes` | `~/.hermes/config.yaml` | `hermes-config.yaml` | `OPENCODEX_HERMES_API_KEY` |
| `openclaw` | `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` | `openclaw.json5` | `OPENCODEX_OPENCLAW_API_KEY` |
| `kimi` | `~/.kimi-code/config.toml` | `kimi-config.toml` | none — loopback placeholder |
| `gajae` | `~/.gjc/agent/models.yml` | `gajae-models.yaml` | non-secret loopback placeholder |
| `dsh` | `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml` (default `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`) | `settings.yaml` | none — non-secret loopback bearer placeholder |
| `mcode` | `~/.minimax/config.yaml` (`MINIMAX_DATA_DIR`, then the legacy `MAVIS_DATA_DIR`, win when set; a relative value is refused) | `mcode-config.yaml` | none — loopback placeholder |
| `zcode` | `~/.zcode/v2/config.json` (`ZCODE_DATA_DIR` wins when set; a relative value is refused) | `config.json` | none — loopback placeholder |
| `prime` | `~/.prime/agent/models.json` (`PRIME_AGENT_CODING_AGENT_DIR` wins when set; a relative value is refused) | `prime-models.json` | none — loopback placeholder |
| `aside` | `~/.aside/u/<account>/models.json` for the account Aside's own `accounts.json` names as current; an unreadable manifest is refused rather than defaulting to an account | `aside-models.json` | none — loopback placeholder |
| `raycast` | `~/.config/raycast/ai/providers.yaml` on macOS and Windows alike (Raycast does not honor `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) | `raycast-providers.yaml` | none — loopback only, no `api_keys` entry is written |
| `omo` | `~/.omo/agent/models.json` (`OMO_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, then `SENPI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, then `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` win in that order when set; a relative value is refused) | `omo-models.json` | none — loopback placeholder |
| `kilo` | first existing `kilo.jsonc`, `kilo.json`, `opencode.jsonc`, `opencode.json`, or `config.json` under `~/.config/kilo` (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` relocates that directory); uses `kilo.jsonc` when none exists | `kilo.jsonc` | `OPENCODEX_KILO_API_KEY` |
| `droid` | `~/.factory/settings.json` (`%USERPROFILE%\.factory\settings.json` on Windows) | `factory-settings.json` | loopback only; no environment variable |

The managed DSH export requires DSH 0.1.0-rc.6 or newer and owns only
`llm-pi-ai.providers.opencodex`. DSH hot reloads that provider; the user's default model and
`deepseek-official` remain untouched. This export is loopback-only and carries no real credential.
DSH 0.1.7 and newer import `settings.yaml` once into the first profile that boots and then rename
it, so the dashboard integration writes the same provider into the `llm-pi-ai` row of the Desktop
profile's `$DSH_HOME/profiles/desktop/cordis.patch.yml` once that profile exists.

opencode interpolates `{env:OPENCODEX_OPENCODE_API_KEY}`. The generated Pi and OMP exports do
not require an environment variable: each carries the literal `opencodex-loopback` placeholder.
This is load-bearing because both clients resolve `apiKey` while building their model lists and
hide the whole provider when an existing config contains an unset env reference. The proxy never
checks the generated placeholder on loopback. OMP supports provider-level headers, but this initial
integration deliberately remains loopback-only; remote `x-opencodex-api-key` wiring is deferred.

The Raycast export is a standalone `providers.yaml` document with one `id: opencodex` element
in the `providers` sequence: `name: OpenCodex`, the proxy's `/v1` base URL, and every routed model
with its `abilities` (`tools` and `system_message` always supported, `vision` from the catalog's
input modalities, `reasoning_effort` when the model has an effort ladder, `temperature` off for
reasoning models). Custom Providers is a Raycast Pro feature, and Raycast watches the file, so a
saved change takes effect without a restart. The format is documented at
[manual.raycast.com/ai/custom-providers](https://manual.raycast.com/ai/custom-providers). No
`api_keys` entry is written, so this export is loopback-only and a non-loopback bind is refused.

The MCode, ZCode and Prime exports are loopback-only for the same reason and likewise carry the
`opencodex-loopback` placeholder rather than a real credential. Prime Agent reads the same
`models.json` contract Pi does, so the two exports produce the same document; only the destination
differs. A relative path in any of those three environment overrides is refused, because the proxy
and the client can have different working directories and would otherwise disagree about which
file is meant.

ZCode 3.8.1 may save runtime-derived `reasoning`, `limit.output`, and default context metadata back
into the generated `provider.opencodex.models` entries. Managed integration status treats only
those documented additions as refreshable drift. Provider identity and connection settings,
including `options.baseURL`, model membership, names, modalities, and any context limit OpenCodex
emitted authoritatively remain protected; editing them reports `conflict / foreign-edit` instead of
overwriting the file. An ownership record created by an older OpenCodex version can recover
automatically when the generated catalog is otherwise unchanged. If both the catalog and the block
changed, re-apply only after reviewing the file because the older record cannot prove which change
was ZCode-derived.

:::caution[Merge, never replace]
`ocx export` never writes your real client config. The destination is printed for you to merge by
hand, and `--out` refuses to overwrite an existing file without `--force`, because replacing a
config destroys the other providers, agents, and MCP entries already in it.
:::

No key is ever serialized. Configs carry either a documented environment reference or a
non-secret loopback placeholder. A loopback address (`127.0.0.1`) alone does not establish keyless
admission: check the target policy and endpoint. Selected-key model/audio commands
still require explicit key input on loopback. Set a referenced variable only when the client schema supports it and
the proxy binds beyond loopback; see
[Remote access](/reference/configuration/server/#remote-access) for how admission keys are issued. Keys for
the upstream providers themselves are a separate thing entirely, configured per
[Providers](/guides/providers/).
The generated gjc integration uses a non-secret loopback placeholder and needs no environment variable. It remains loopback-only; it does not configure remote admission credentials.

The same payload is served by `GET /api/client-config` and rendered on the dashboard's API tab, so
the CLI, the API, and the GUI use the same bytes.

## Runtime and configuration

### `ocx system <status|settings|startup|diagnostics|sync|codex-app-server|codex-restart|update|codex-cli-update> ...`

Manage headless runtime settings, startup, sync, diagnostics, and updates.

`ocx system codex-restart --yes` restarts Codex app-servers and fully quits and relaunches the
Codex desktop app, through the same module as `ocx sync --restart-codex`. When the proxy itself
is running inside the Codex app, the command refuses with an actionable message instead of
promising a handoff it cannot complete.

```bash
ocx system settings --stream-mode eager-relay
```

Additional system booleans take on/off: `--show-codex-credits`, `--account-picker`,
`--main-account-hard-lock`, `--ultra-fast-tier`, and `--fast-rows`. They write only
explicit fields and may combine with existing system options. Showing credits is
a display preference, not paid-credit opt-in; system Ultra Fast is separate from
provider Fast.

```bash
ocx system settings --json
ocx system settings --show-codex-credits on --json
ocx system settings --json
```

New-option writes report `{ok:true, settings: observedFields, catalogRefreshPending}`.
Ultra Fast performs same-target GET read-back because PUT omits that value. A
missing/mismatched/read-failed observation stays `verification:"unverified"` with
`unverifiedFields` and a nonzero exit after acceptance; requested values are never
substituted for observations. Combined desktop switches retain stored/effective
and apply facts. Pending catalog or deferred/refused native apply is distinct from
a saved setting. False pending is not proof that every client has reloaded.

`ocx system update` updates OpenCodex itself. The separate Codex CLI inspection surface is:

```bash
ocx system codex-cli-update check --json
```

`check` makes no package-registry request and inspects bounded configured-candidate provenance evidence,
including a redacted executable location and ownership evidence. Trusted published-launcher context authenticates
the candidate snapshot, not successful Codex execution. Because this one-shot command never executes Codex,
environment and persisted candidates remain report-only (`managed: false`, normally `selection_unattested`);
`selectionAttested` remains `false`. The JSON report exposes `candidateAvailable`, `candidateVersion`, `candidateSource`,
and `selectionAttested`. Inspecting the configured candidate requires a trusted published-launcher context;
a direct Bun/source launch has no such proof, ignores ambient and persisted candidate state, and may report
`candidate_unavailable` on POSIX. On Windows this first slice performs no candidate or configuration filesystem I/O:
only a proof-captured absolute environment candidate can receive lexical app-bundle or version-manager labels;
every other Windows candidate fails closed. Because that slice never consults persisted state, a Windows run
with no captured environment candidate reports `windows_inspection_deferred` rather than `candidate_unavailable`:
the command cannot observe whether a Codex CLI is installed, so it reports the deferral instead of asserting
that no candidate exists. The command does not execute Codex or a package manager, repair a shim,
write configuration or cache state, stop a process, or install anything. App-bundled, recognized
version-manager, unverified standalone, and ambiguous shim states are reported as unmanaged or unknown
and are never classified as managed.

On Windows, a captured bare command such as `CODEX_CLI_PATH=codex`, a remote path, or a device path reports `candidate_path_unavailable` instead. Those cases have a captured candidate; its path is not eligible for this inspection.

#### Explicit installation observation on Windows x64

```

`attest` is an opt-in, read-only observation of a Windows x64 npm installation. With no options it identifies the selected candidate from the proof-bound launcher snapshot — the configured `CODEX_CLI_PATH` or the first `codex` on the captured PATH, with an OpenCodex wrapper resolving to its renamed `codex.opencodex-real.cmd` npm backing. Supplying all four absolute paths overrides discovery; discovery only proposes paths and the held-handle observation remains the authority. `--candidate` must name the standard npm `<prefix>/codex.cmd` or `<prefix>/node_modules/@openai/codex/bin/codex.js`. `--npm-cli` must end in `node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js`; `--node` names an explicit `node.exe`. App bundles, recognized version-manager layouts, opencodex-owned shims without their npm backing, and custom wrappers are refused.

Native handles hold the ancestor directories and files during bounded reads. Unsupported platforms, reparse points/junctions, conflicting writers, unsafe paths, and oversized files are refused. The fixed report contains no paths: `status` is `observed` or `refused`, with `installationIdentityObserved`; `selectionAttested`, `managed`, and `applyAllowed` remain `false`. Check `status`, not just the process exit code: a reported refusal can exit 0.

An observed identity or digest describes those files during this observation. It is not a durable update permit and does not prove the selected runtime, the past installer, effective npm configuration, or tool authenticity. The supplied Node is observed only, not proven to be the Node a launcher would select. No target is executed; no registry request, installation, configuration write, or process control occurs. The existing Windows `check` command still performs no candidate/configuration filesystem I/O.

### `ocx config [show|get|set|unset|validate|export|import] ...`

`ocx config [show] [--json] [--source]` displays the local configuration without a running proxy. Omitting `show` also works with either flag or both, in either order. `--source` includes diagnostic source, error, and warning fields and is only accepted for display. `--json` may precede an explicit action; it does not change which action runs. Repeated `--json` or `--source` flags and unknown arguments are rejected.

Inspect and safely modify validated OpenCodex configuration. `show` and `get` mask secrets. Import
validates before writing and requires `--yes`.

Display and mutation output strip credentials from proxy URLs while retaining the host and port.
`direct` and credential-free proxy values stay readable. `export` preserves credentials so the
backup can restore the configuration; store exported files as secrets.

### Usage from a connected client

`ocx usage` reads the connected hub with this client's enrolled data key. Human output identifies the hub source and client-key scope; `--json` returns the same scoped data. Range, surface, provider/model filters and custom `--since`/`--until` bounds remain available. Account breakdowns and other clients' records are not shared. An old or unavailable hub produces an explicit error instead of substituting local usage; upgrade the hub if it does not support this read.

The read-only data-plane endpoint is `GET /v1/usage`, using `x-opencodex-api-key` with a configured client key. Environment-wide and admin keys are refused. It accepts `range`, `surface`, `provider`, `model`, `since`, and `until`; unknown/repeated options and caller-selected key IDs are rejected. Oversized skipped rows retain the explicit incomplete-history warning.

## Explain a listed request

Human `ocx logs` output includes `id=<request-id>`. Pass that value to `ocx logs explain <request-id>` to inspect routing decisions. Rows without an ID or with control characters in their ID omit the field instead of displaying a different lookup key. JSON and JSONL output retain their existing schema.

## Routing profile lookup status

`ocx route policy show <id>` exits 4 when the profile does not exist. Missing or invalid command arguments exit 2. Scripts can distinguish a missing profile from incorrect usage.

## Upstream error details

When an upstream error envelope contains several message fields, OpenCodex uses the first nonblank string in its established priority order. Empty or malformed fields no longer hide a valid fallback diagnostic.

### Forced Claude Code subagent model

The Subagents page offers **Force all subagents onto one model**, off by default. Select an exposed roster-style id, such as `combo/tev-auto`, then enable the switch. The roster is offered first; unavailable saved roster entries cannot be force targets.

`ocx agent subagents force combo/tev-auto` sets `claudeCode.subagentModelForce`; `ocx agent subagents force -` clears it. `ocx agent status` reports the setting. `GET /api/subagent-models` returns `force`, `forceAvailable`, and `forceStatus`; `PUT` accepts `{ "force": "combo/tev-auto" }` or `{ "force": null }` without changing the roster. Omitting `force` leaves it unchanged. Invalid or unexposed targets are rejected on write; stale targets are reported and skipped at launch.

This takes effect on the **next routed `ocx claude` launch**, injecting `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` as an explicit proxy alias (with `[1m]` only for an authoritative million-token window; native Claude targets use a reversible native alias) and `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE=1`. Each nonempty shell-exported variable independently wins. Native launches inject neither variable; plain `claude` is not affected. No plugin files or `settings.json` are modified by this setting.

Claude Code **2.1.257 or newer** is required for FORCE. Plugin and built-in agents (including Explore/Plan) and per-call model arguments are overridden. Forks and subagent skills with `model: inherit` keep the main conversation model. The main loop and Haiku/small-fast sidecars are unaffected. Existing roster files remain available.

The dashboard warns about old or unknown CLI versions, unavailable targets, and either variable already present in `settings.json` → `env` (which overrides launch env). Detection is read-only and server-local: it cannot inspect another launch shell, another machine, or project-local settings. An unknown result is not proof of force support.
