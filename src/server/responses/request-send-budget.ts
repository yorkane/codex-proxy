 *
 * `remainingTransientSendBudget(cap)` treats `cap` as a ceiling on what REMAINS, which is the
 * right shape for the fixed constant: every leg may ask for up to three, and the request-wide
 * base allowance is what actually bounds the total. A configured `transientRetryOn5xx.attempts`
 * is documented as the total for one request including the first send, so it has to be reduced
 * by what the request already sent before it is intersected with that allowance. Passing it
 * straight through would make it a per-leg ceiling instead, and a request configured at one send
 * could still reach upstream again on a recovery leg (#4893).
 *
 * An absent policy returns the constant unchanged, so a provider that configures nothing behaves
 * exactly as it does today at every call site.
