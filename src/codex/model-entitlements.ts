/**
 * Version authority, in precedence order:

 *    below `GATED_MODEL_CLIENT_VERSION_FLOOR`. Retained sync refreshes runtime evidence before
 *    discovery, which is what makes this usable here; the persisted file itself carries no
 *    freshness guarantee.
 * 3. the floor this build's own bundled roster records for the models being gated
 *    (`GATED_MODEL_CLIENT_VERSION_FLOOR`).
 *
 * Tier 3 exists because background catalog sync has no request and, on a host where Codex
 * has never been resolved, no persisted runtime either — yet it is exactly the path that
 * publishes account-confirmed native rows. Skipping discovery there suppressed the rows this
 * fix is meant to restore. The floor is not invented: it is the version this build's own
 * snapshot states the gated models require, so asking under it is the narrowest question
 * that can still return them.
 *
 * The floor binds tier 2 as well, and that is the whole of #3436. #3022 gave tier 3 the
 * measured minimum but left tier 2 to speak for itself, so a host whose persisted runtime was
 * REAL but OLD — 0.141.0 against a measured 0.144.0 — asked upstream under a version upstream
 * filters on, got an honest roster with no gpt-5.6, and lost sol/terra/luna everywhere. That
 * made an outdated CLI strictly worse than no CLI at all, since the runtime-less host already
 * asked at the floor and kept its models. The clamp only ever raises: a runtime at or above
 * the floor is preserved exactly, because a newer client can drive models the floor cannot
 * name.
 *
 * Which tier answers is a question about WHICH QUESTION IS BEING ASKED, not about background
 * versus request path — `isDirectCallerEntitledToCodexModel` and both authorization paths in
 * `auth-context.ts` are inbound requests that reach tier 2 because they carry no version:
 *
 * - No inbound version: the caller is asking whether the ACCOUNT owns the model. Upstream
 *   only incidentally filters that answer by version, so ask at no less than the floor.
 * - An inbound version: the caller is asking what THAT CLIENT may use. Answer verbatim, even
 *   when it is older than the floor. Clamping there would advertise rows the client told us
 *   it cannot drive (#2548) and would turn an honest `unknown` into a cached `denied`.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `0.0.0`-style fallback. A placeholder describes a client that
 * predates every gated model, which is what made upstream answer with an empty roster and
 * turned absent evidence into a manufactured confirmed negative (#2886).

 * - 검토한 주요 대안: Infer access from plan labels, learn only after a failed prompt, or rewrite
 *   Daybreak to its current physical model.
 * - 선택한 방식: Cache bounded authenticated `/models` rosters per credential generation and
 *   fail closed for unconfirmed accounts.
 * - 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: Plan names do not prove grants, post-failure
 *   learning spends a real turn, and model rewriting changes the requested product identity.
 * - 장점, 단점 및 영향: Catalog and routing share exact account evidence. Cold gated requests
