/**
 * `JSON.parse("null")` returns `null` without throwing, so a `try/catch` around a body parse
 * cannot see it. #1240 closed that at the SSE *frame* root for the four SSE parsers. Two rungs
 * were never swept, because neither is an SSE frame parser:
 *
 *   - the BUFFERED body root, on the `parseResponse` path reached from
 *     `src/server/responses/core.ts` for non-streaming turns;
 *   - the NDJSON frame root in the Command Code transport.
 *
 * And inside a well-formed anthropic body, `content` was consumed unchecked, so the #1332/#2232
 * nested-shape ladder was open there too.
 *
 * Every assertion below is written as PARITY against a control that was already handled correctly
 * — an unparseable body, or the same field on a sibling adapter — so the test states the actual
 * requirement rather than re-encoding each adapter's exact wording and drifting when it changes.
