# Campaign status

Status: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE. The active regression and release follow-up is tracked in [its separate open unit](../../_plan/260920_regression_release/000_scope.md). All sixteen original implementation issues are now closed. Final dashboard #5197 landed as `ed44e04a933f6d4d62d2e049bf7606f08d347b06`; #5118 was closed after ancestry/tree checks and current source/fixture evidence. The owner explicitly requested immediate integration while macOS verification remained unfinished, and that timing exception is recorded on the PR. No full-platform pass is claimed for that incomplete run. Complete hosted regression, main/preview promotion, release publication and post-publication verification remain outstanding. Two non-blocking review observations are retained for follow-up. The heartbeat remains active.

## Owners

| Lane | State | Issues |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime | Delivered | All assigned implementation work landed |
| Policy and operator | Delivered | Final dashboard landed; release remains coordinator-owned |

Private orchestration records retain the actual task handles and wake cursors. The current coordinator heartbeat is ACTIVE at a 20-minute interval. It follows the two existing implementation owners; it must not duplicate them. The coordinator owns integration and issue closure.

## Current evidence

- The original 24 staged analysis documents remain intact.
- Local suites, focused tests, typecheck, build, install and runtime/service execution remain prohibited.
- The original issue states and every closed issue's landing ancestry were rechecked; see [the acceptance ledger](037_acceptance_ledger.md).
- Remaining work is current-head verification, issue-specific implementation, integration and closure. Dispatch alone is not completion.

## Issue outcomes

Closed: #5109, #5110, #5111, #5112, #5113, #5114, #5115, #5116, #5117, #5118, #5119, #5120, #5121, #5122, #5123, #5124.
Open implementation issues: none. Regression, promotion and release remain open.

The entries below are chronological historical checkpoints. Their earlier open/closed states do not override the current summary or acceptance ledger.

## Integration-cycle opening

Runtime owner has completed its transport source orientation and is reading existing test conventions while independent audits cover larger issues. Policy owner registered a thirteen-phase roadmap, including report-before-enforcement and server-preview-before-client wiring dependencies, and entered its own plan phase. Its one shell quoting failure was corrected by the owner; it is not a blocker. No runtime test was run or claimed. No PR had been reported at that opening observation.

Independent integration-procedure audit: PASS, no concrete blockers. This authorizes collecting/reviewing delivered PRs under the recorded gates, not merging a future PR without its own proof. Latest scoped PR lookup returned no linked open PR. Both owners remain active; the coordinator awaits their deliverables under the registered heartbeat rather than repeatedly polling GitHub.

## First delivered PR

#5125 addresses #5109 at `303e731d04eb00950922ba7d9749875e0a643551`, base dev. It is an ordinary standalone PR. Main diff review and independent regression audit are underway; exact-head hosted CI is running. See `021_pr_5125.md`. Issue remains open.

#5125 coordinator feedback: fix the new 101 reachability comment/PR prose without expanding upgrade scope; dependent #5111 branch must include the parent correction. Independent regression review remains pending; no repeat CI poll until a new head/actionable result.

## Current transport stack

- #5125 / #5109: latest observed head `6557add72b48e91f8fdb5805a82192777b7d3286`, dev base. Parent prose correction is in; test now observes target connection close before fixture teardown. Current-head CI still needs a later result read. Old-head cancellations are supersession, not current failure.
- #5126 / #5111: observed head `161f724361753fb2ad80863ceadb41990b0f024c`, parent base at `4c7fe1e...`; coding review underway. Owner notified to propagate latest parent before merge readiness. Ordinary/manual membership confirmed empty native-stack lookup.
- Both PRs attached to coordinator. No merge/close. Full regression execution remains hosted only.

#5126 is now REVIEW-BLOCKED at the reviewed head: source/socket errors are relabeled as decoder failures, and two downstream error-category consumers need updates. The owner received exact source locations, distinctions from pre-existing abort debt, and regression requirements. The same independent reviewer is retained for interdiff review after a corrected head. #5125 remains separately eligible for exact-head verification; neither issue is closed.

Policy lane acknowledged its complete dependency-aware twelve-PR roadmap across the nine owned issues and is drafting detailed per-PR designs with six parallel workers. Runtime lane has source specifications for the remaining state issues and awaits the custom-input implementation. These are observed progress statements, not delivered/verified fixes.

A targeted pre-publication scan of the policy lane's new convention document found review-routing attribution inconsistent with the user's public-prose constraint. The owner was asked to replace it with neutral role wording and scan incoming worker plans before committing; exact routing remains private task configuration. No main-side edit was made in the owner's checkout.

Verified wait checkpoint: both native task handles remain active, not stopped. Runtime owner reports custom-input work returned for review and is now correcting both error-category consumers for #5126. Policy owner reports its static-policy designs complete with remaining operator designs under review. These reports do not satisfy merge/issue-close criteria; exact updated heads and hosted results remain required.

## Verified completed issue

#5109 CLOSED: #5125 MERGED into dev as `4e7d7132d8f8a7d46e460b48c5104a6d5ced4567`, after all applicable exact-head CI passed and regression execution was confirmed in hosted logs. Closure reread succeeded. Progress: 1 of 16 issues resolved; 15 remain open. Dev post-merge CI is queued in the initial snapshot, so no next overlapping merge is allowed yet. #5126 requires parent alignment plus remaining review fixes. #5127 is independently open for #5110 and has review fixes pending at a newer head.

## Review and hosted verification checkpoint

- #5126 at76b226: static corrections passed independent review, but exact-head hosted test2/4 failed one new successful-completion peer-destruction assertion. Owner is investigating lifecycle-versus-oracle semantics with primary evidence; no blind rerun or timeout change accepted.
- #5127 atf18c: type/oracle fixes reviewed; exact null abort reason still needs correction.
- #5129 at641f407: High introduced raw apply_patch prefix mismatch found; owner asked to preserve grammar-specific hold and add the missing routed patch regression.
- #5130 at2e4681: acceptance corrections and explicit WS mismatch/recovery coverage requested; no merge approval.
- CI producers for several campaign PRs and dev remain queued. Runtime owner acknowledged holding additional pushes while continuing static implementation. Policy owner continues audited roadmap work; both task handles are active.

No further issue has closed. Overall goal remains active in integration/build; no C/D completion claim is justified for the full campaign yet.

Both owners remain active. Runtime owner is batching received review corrections without adding new CI launches; policy owner completed its audit amendments and is correcting orchestration argument serialization. Coordinator supplied safe argv/attest-file guidance for that tooling friction without altering the child's FSM or verdicts. No stopped-task claim or duplicate task creation was made.

Policy owner completed its audited roadmap cycle and started the #5120 documentation correction cycle. Coordinator clarified that a genuine docs-only PR may use its normal event-applicable documentation/lightweight checks while full runtime launches are throttled; no CI skip override is involved. Runtime owner is completing coherent review-fix batches, including the missing WebSocket regression, before updated pushes.

#5134 MERGED to dev as `1b54f2940b038e5aba0665fed2a606e30773dd35` after all applicable docs/structure/aggregate and separate control gates passed at44f8fa1. #5120 closure completed and state reread. Progress: 2 of 16 resolved (#5109, #5120), 14 still open. Prepared #5122 commit90b646c passed independent static fourteen-file review; hosted execution proof and publication remain pending scheduling. #5123 prepared commit remains under independent core/lifecycle review.

Prepared send-accounting commit90b646c independently passed all fourteen-file static review; publication awaits capacity. Prepared writer-ownership commitbf5feb02 received changes-requested from both private core and lifecycle reviews; owner is amending it before publication. No new claim of enforcement readiness is made. PR #5138 for #5121 is now attached; its three-file diff adds the invariant declaration, Lab contract link and existing test backlink without changing runtime code.

Current prepared-change review checkpoint: send-accounting commit90b646c is statically approved; writer-ownership commitbf5feb02 remains private and changes-requested pending corrections. PR #5138's invariant binding is source-reviewed and running its applicable checks. Coordinator has explicitly prohibited further partial-job reruns; the existing #5129 attempt2 is observed live/queued and is not restarted merely because observation times out. Runtime owner follow-up instructions are queued through task messaging; a queued message is not claimed as acknowledged until reflected in task progress.

Runtime dev run35432310593 at52c427 is live and has only macOS2/2 remaining in the current job snapshot. #5130 received a further corrected head a863c4b; same reviewer is checking acceptance and negative cases. #5127 remains exact-head green and statically merge-compatible, pending the prior dev guard. #5138 remains on hosted verification.

Integration collision observation: dev52c427 run35432310593 was cancelled when another authorized integration advanced dev toe668aa (#5131); new run35434188285 is live/queued. This supersession is not a test failure, but repeated dev movement prevents the recorded post-merge guard from completing. Coordinator read the reference task's idle state and sent one question-only merge-slot coordination message, preserving its work/automation ownership. Requested the current dev run finish before the next overlapping runtime landing. No stale run rerun or other task cancellation was performed.

#5127 MERGED to dev9824aa55bb0ed5fb27ca92ed0851a2fd5529123c; #5110 CLOSED after proof reread. Progress is now 3/16 (#5109, #5110, #5120), thirteen open. Next merge slot was coordinated with the reference integrator and returned after landing. Only actual acceptance/merge/closure is counted, never prepared commits or queued CI.

## Monitor recovery

A peer task reported accidentally deleting this campaign's previous heartbeat. Read-only host inspection confirmed only the reference task monitor remained. The coordinator restored the saved campaign prompt, actual owner IDs and 20-minute schedule using the automation tool. New ID `opencodex-01a0b850`, target this coordinator, ACTIVE status and saved fields were reread successfully. Existing implementation tasks were not restarted. Monitor mutation now explicitly requires checking name, kind and target identity; another task's monitor is never treated as a duplicate by directory order.

Current reviewer disposition: #5126 c109586 and #5129 b1b604 passed exact interdiff review; both require their own new-head hosted proof and resolved GitHub findings. #5130 hosted old-message expectations were identified exactly and owner is updating only those contract assertions, retaining behavior checks. #5138 6986fc documentation amendments accepted by coordinator; hosted proof and GitHub thread resolution pending. No additional issue closure is claimed.

Scheduling exception reported by runtime owner: two previously held branches were pushed without a PR, and the writer branch triggered Service lifecycle run35435244324 because that workflow has path-scoped push triggers without a branch restriction. Coordinator did not authorize that hold exception and corrected the assumption that a public branch push is unpublished or required for reviewing local commits. No remote deletion/cancellation was authorized; existing run may finish as evidence, while further writer-branch publication remains held pending exact-commit review. All matching workflows must be inspected before future push scheduling. Reviewers can read unpushed commits from the shared Git object database.

## Current integration checkpoint

Independent review accepted #5130 head4209818 as a test-only correction preserving the shared public error contract. #5126 c109586, #5129 b1b604, #5130 4209818 and #5138 6986fc still need current-head applicable macOS/aggregate results; current GitHub review threads are resolved except one documented pre-existing direct-stream grammar limitation on #5129, under coordinator scope disposition. No additional merge or closure is claimed.

Writer ownership commit1661a920 remains changes-requested after private core and lifecycle review. Concrete corrective requirements were sent to the owner; details remain in ignored scratch. The policy owner was instructed to advance the next audited independent documentation slice while hosted work waits, preserving the current invariant PR head.

New follow-up #5151 tracks the verified pre-existing direct-SSE reordered/escaped wrapper-key limitation. It is separate from the original sixteen implementation commitments. #5129 review disposition is accepted for its routed scope; exact-head hosted proof still pending. The bug-form chooser was inspected in the browser; submission used the matching form headings and bug label through CLI after the browser radio interaction failed. No duplicate issue was created.

CI scheduling update: with existing Linux producers drained, one new send-accounting PR for statically reviewed90b646c is authorized for its normal hosted checks. The writer-ownership branch remains review-blocked. Both implementation tasks retain the original no-local-execution restriction and no merge/closure authority. Coordinator verified the current heartbeat remains ACTIVE at a20-minute interval with the correct task target.

#5126 MERGED as af4f744c75 and #5111 CLOSED after exact-head CI, review and landing checks. Progress:4/16 resolved (#5109,#5110,#5111,#5120). New owned PRs #5152 (send accounting, head90b646c) and #5153 (SOCKS5 documentation, head4a576ba0) are attached and under hosted verification; documentation review dispatched. Corrected writer ownership head5328a723 is under two independent private interdiff reviews. #5129 final independent review is being refreshed before integration despite green hostedCI.

#5129 MERGED asbb2fa5ab25; #5113 CLOSED after landing verification. Progress5/16. #5130 runtime CI passed; its only current control execution was cancelled, so coordinator verified no live duplicate and reran only run35435033238; attempt2 succeeded. #5138 runtime CI now success. #5153 has two source-confirmed documentation blockers (configured NO_PROXY semantics and adjacent SOCKS fake-IP wording), returned to the owner.

#5130 MERGED asacd43bf442; #5124 CLOSED after verification. Progress6/16; current cumulative dev tipacd43bf442 is being tracked. #5138 has completed green proof and is undergoing final integration.

#5138 MERGED as5ce51cb554; #5121 CLOSED after verification. Progress7/16 (#5109,#5110,#5111,#5113,#5120,#5121,#5124). The policy owner may proceed with the next audited authority/policy slice while fixing #5153; one new full-CI lane launch is authorized. #5152 has an actual hosted test3 failure under investigation; no merge approved.

The reference integrator requested the next slot for #5128 and #5107. Coordinator confirmed no immediate merge candidate remains in this campaign and will revalidate the resulting dev before the next integration. Our current #5152 failure is independently traced to a zero-dispatch fixture and is not attributed to the referenced server-auth fixture issue.

#5153 MERGED asf117c20d12; #5119 CLOSED after verification. Progress8/16 (#5109,#5110,#5111,#5113,#5119,#5120,#5121,#5124). Remaining #5112/#5114/#5115/#5116/#5117/#5118/#5122/#5123 remain open. Policy owner is moving into contract-authority implementation; runtime owner is investigating fresh #5152 CI and the private ownership API corrections.

Writer-ownership head86eb1d06 passed the final private identity-boundary review; the owner may publish it for hosted verification. Runtime integration remains held pending the separately assigned sideband failure. #5152 fullCI at225e885 and #5155 fullCI at7d17f497 passed, but each has a valid newer review blocker requiring a corrected head and fresh proof; green old-head CI is not treated as merge readiness.

2026-09-19T13:40Z: #5170 merged after all applicable hosted checks passed and current dev/head/actor were revalidated; its required follow-up task is complete. #5171 corrected the failing substring assertion at `2fdd21004eb256890ae9d7a54baab6c00653c65d`; this proves whole-policy non-mutation and preserves the legitimate registry-only value. Child #5174 at `7b25d449d9828019de8a9799f51539863d2eec68` migrates actual consumers; two disjoint independent reviews are active. #5157 at `271139883a552f1aac9ce3f847eb94e3327e5efc` cleanup re-review has no blocking finding; one conditional teardown improvement was sent to its owner. Hosted checks are still pending. Heartbeat ownership and ACTIVE state rechecked; no original issue closure claimed.

Report parent #5162 merged at `8a030721b3ffc909ca7d8b05ca0b7c873c1493a1` after current-head CI and reviews passed. Child #5167 still requires retarget/restack and fresh verification. Original resolved count remains 10/16; #5112 remains open.

Runtime owner pushed `9e789c1613b22109dd0398e9619be8902bff9662` for #5157: management ACL failure injection is restricted to the token file, the stream retry fixture uses its narrow relay-platform seam, and the direct combo fixture holds a writer lease and drains its response. Assertions and production ownership rules are unchanged in this delta. Independent review and fresh hosted CI are required. Policy owner is implementing #5117 in its isolated checkout while repairing #5174; #5115 and #5118 remain required scope.

Ownership amendment: #5115 moved to the runtime owner after the policy owner confirmed no implementation writer or commit existed. Independent preparation can proceed on current dev because its known-model hint region is unchanged by #5174; final landing remains after #5171 and #5174, with a fresh integration base, reviewed delta and exact-head hosted CI. The two-owner limit, acceptance criteria and execution restrictions are unchanged.

#5157 integrated and #5123 closed after final acceptance verification. Current progress is11/16, with five remaining original issues. See031_pr_5157.md for exact-head CI and merge evidence.

Second ownership amendment: #5118 transferred to the existing runtime owner after confirmation that no implementation writer, branch or commit existed. Server and dashboard delivery remain required, with the prior private pre-build audit incorporated before implementation. Metrics-to-preview shared-route integration is serialized; preparation can proceed in disjoint files. Dashboard evidence must satisfy the actual file-based screenshot gate using hosted artifacts under the no-local-build restriction. No third implementation owner was created.

#5177 is integrated and #5115 closed after complete acceptance verification. Current progress is12/16; remaining issues are #5112/#5114/#5117/#5118. The independent decode-hint change landed before policy migration after a recorded source-based sequencing amendment.

The current-task heartbeat was updated and read back ACTIVE with the existing twenty-minute cadence. It now reflects twelve closed issues, runtime ownership of #5118, policy ownership of #5112/#5114/#5117, and the remaining publication/visual verification duties. Other task monitors were not modified.

Current verified ledger remains thirteen closed issues and three open (#5114/#5117/#5118). The policy owner now owns only the dashboard child layer of #5118 in addition to #5114/#5117; the runtime owner retains its server, writer, routes, backend tests and documentation. The runtime handoff confirmed no dashboard writer, branch or commit existed. The two-owner limit, manual parent-child delivery and actual screenshot requirement remain unchanged.

Fourth public checkpoint #5218 was opened at449d1144 after independent six-file publication review and the requested wording corrections. It records fourteen verified closures and remaining work; hosted controls/public review remain pending. All fourteen recorded merge ancestors and closed issue states were freshly rechecked against devfec3add6ce.

Fourth checkpoint revision: public review identified detailed unshipped working notes in the preview record. The full notes were retained in ignored scratch; neutral progress/evidence wording replaced them and passed re-review. PR5218 now uses b6c0cd02224de03b62e25034f2c7d32bf02a1b64; the finding was answered and resolved. New-head hosted/public review remains pending, and no claim is made that prior remote objects were erased.

Latest execution update: #5174 e5d is held after macOS shard1 reported actual fixture assertions and subprocess timeouts before its job deadline; diagnosis is active. #5185 ea8 exact-head run35467605982 completed successfully and public review is active. The dashboard final source cascade is prepared locally; its final-parent publication and fresh hosted-artifact captures follow verified server integration.

Fourth public checkpoint #5218 merged as1883f2fff9b395dea5d849730997dac683e59939 at2026-09-19T20:55:23Z. Final headfb978cc2eb passed applicable hosted run35468644496 and controls; both public findings were resolved. Actual dev ancestry and merged tree11341f4cf66d2963847c05d1c3fe1e74e705e87f were verified. The fourteen-closure checkpoint is now public; later source/CI updates remain active working records.

Final server run35471595302 succeeded at3a8e73d417, and the tested merge tree was verified equal to the accepted union. A subsequent public canonical-route consistency finding is being corrected before server integration. The earlier pass is not reused for a future changed head.

Final-audit correction: the earlier fifteen-closure checkpoint was an accurate GitHub state, but original transport verification rows remained weak. #5109/#5110 are now explicitly open until a focused regression follow-up executes and lands. Existing implementation and successful receipts remain valid for the scenarios they cover. No acceptance criterion was removed or weakened.

The dashboard delivery owner encountered a terminal execution-capacity failure after source and capture completion. The same existing task was resumed with available capacity, preserving its worktree and scoped ownership. No duplicate delivery lane or third main task was created. Remaining work is final capture-asset publication, independent visual evidence, applicable hosted checks and coordinator integration.

Later verification: run35483995896 attempt1 completed SUCCESS at source278513a79e, including all event-applicable jobs and both macOS shards. The earlier integration timing exception remains a historical fact; the formerly pending source-PR platform checks are now complete. Full main-through-candidate regression, promotion and release remain separate follow-up work.
