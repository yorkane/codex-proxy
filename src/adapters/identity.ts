/**
 * Central routed-model identity repair.
 *
 * Codex sends the SAME GPT-5 identity line to EVERY model at request time (the per-model catalog
 * `base_instructions` is ignored on the wire). For routed, non-OpenAI providers that line is both
 * wrong (the model isn't GPT-5) and a liability: the previous fix replaced it with text that
 * advertised "...served through / running via the opencodex proxy", which leaked our proxy identity
 * into the upstream payload — a signature no first-party client (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Kiro) ever
 * sends, and a likely ToS trigger.
 *
 * The replacement keeps the necessary instruction (don't misreport as GPT-5/OpenAI), names the
 * model id that is actually sent on the wire when it is safe to interpolate, and names no proxy.
 * Provider-native identity blocks (e.g. the anthropic OAuth "You are a Claude agent..." prefix)
 * are layered on TOP of this by the individual adapters; this module never claims to be a specific
 * first-party client.
