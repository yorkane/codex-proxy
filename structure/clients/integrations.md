# Client Integrations

Shared parsing and streaming follow the [request-copy](../transports/byte-accounting.md#request-copy-accounting) and [stream-buffer accounting](../transports/byte-accounting.md#stream-buffer-accounting) contracts.

The client-integration subsystem writes one generated OpenCodex provider contribution into a
third-party client's existing config without taking ownership of the rest of that file. Its core
promise is reversibility: apply snapshots first, writes atomically, records exactly what it owns,
and refuses refresh, disable, or restore when the current file cannot be classified safely.

Shared response support has a separate [bounded ingestion contract](../transports/inventory.md#bounded-response-ingestion-and-orcarouter-login):
raw-byte callers own their byte and deadline budgets and inherit best-effort cancellation.
The OrcaRouter login ceiling applies to its key exchange; client configuration files retain the
parsing and ownership rules below.

## Module Responsibilities

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/clients/config-export.ts` | Pure per-client config builders and the exact managed fragments each client receives. It never writes files. |
| `src/integrations/registry.ts` | Canonical config/detection paths, source-preserving YAML declarations, writer-lock behavior, and client IDs. |
| `src/integrations/config-io.ts` | Bounded file loading and parsing. Values that cannot round-trip through the target serializer are rejected before mutation. |
| `src/integrations/state.ts` | The single `absent` / `current` / `stale` / `conflict` / `unsafe` classifier used by status and every writer operation. |
| `src/integrations/ownership.ts` | Durable ownership records: file, generated contribution, protected contribution, exact fragment paths, and operation identity. |
| `src/integrations/ownership-policy.ts` | Client-scoped declarations for fields a client is documented to derive after apply. It must never contain a broad format-wide exemption. |
| `src/integrations/writer.ts` | Apply, refresh, disable, and restore transactions, including snapshot-first ordering, compare-before-commit, and compensation. |
| `src/integrations/store.ts` / `journal.ts` | One-root persistence for ownership records, operation history, snapshots, and retention maintenance. |

## Data Flow

```text
client registry + export context
  -> build managed contribution
  -> load and parse current config
  -> classify exact recorded fragments
  -> snapshot prior bytes
  -> merge or remove only recorded paths
  -> compare current bytes again
  -> atomic write
  -> ownership record + operation journal
```

Status and mutation must use the same classifier. A special case added only to a status endpoint
would be misleading because refresh or disable could still reject the same file; a special case
added only to a writer would let a mutation bypass the state users saw.

Gajae export and managed refresh share the loopback-only provider builder. It writes the
non-secret `LOOPBACK_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER` as `apiKey`, so the client can activate the provider
without a separately populated environment variable. The managed contribution owns only the
provider block in `models.yml`; default presets and proxy routing in `config.yml` remain user-owned.

TOML temporal scalars cannot survive the JSON-cloned merge representation with their types
intact. The common parser refuses documents containing them before either status or mutation
proceeds, including nested arrays and inline tables. Quoted date strings remain supported.

## Catalog visibility

Management export and CLI export apply the canonical routed catalog visibility filter before
serialization: provider selections, disabled models, and pending initial selection all constrain
the client roster. The full management list remains available for selection. Native rows retain
their existing visibility rules.

## Owned catalog convergence

Visibility, selected-model and preset writes refresh already-owned Pi/Aside contributions after
persisting the selection. Explicit sync refreshes MCode, Pi and Aside. The shared catalog-refresh
fan-out loads the filtered roster lazily once, leaves unowned clients alone, and reports each
refusal independently. Existing coordinated writers retain all no-clobber and ownership checks.
Implicit refresh operations use distinct flight keys: overlapping desired catalogs return busy
rather than joining a write of a different catalog and reporting false success.

## Fast model selectors

The serving proxy resolves `fastRowAvailable` on every management model row, including its
`fastRows` setting (default true), canonical eligibility, native upstream tier evidence, and
exact-ID collisions checked before disabled rows are filtered. Management and CLI projections
carry the boolean into the shared client serializers. Only true creates an additive `--fast`
selector, preserving the underlying provider, model ID, modalities, limits, and effort metadata.
False or missing metadata never causes local inference, so old or disabled remote hubs remain
authoritative. Existing client configs receive the entries on export or managed refresh. A Dashboard
save refreshes enabled native clients and already-owned file integrations when the running proxy port
is available; otherwise the operator refreshes the integration or client catalog explicitly.

## Model input capability exports

All registered integrations consume the shared catalog, including [Anthropic seed image metadata](../runtime.md#capability-aware-image-admission), through their existing schema-specific exports:

| Client | Per-model output |
| --- | --- |
| OpenCode | `attachment`, `modalities.input` |
| Pi, OMP, Prime, Aside, omo, Gajae, DSH | `input` (text/image only) |
| ZCode | `modalities.input` (text/image only) |
| Cline | `modalities.input`, `supportsVision` |
| Hermes | `supports_vision` (see below) |
| OpenClaw | `input`, filtered to declared text/image/video/audio; omitted when none remain |
| Kimi Code | `capabilities: ["image_in"]` only for declared image input; omitted for unknown/text-only models |
| MiniMax Code | No per-model image capability field emitted |
| Raycast | `abilities.vision.supported` |

No exporter infers image support from a model name. Existing client eligibility filters and ownership/refresh rules remain unchanged; exports do not add fields to schemas without a supported mapping.

## Hermes Model Capabilities

Hermes cannot infer custom-provider capabilities from its built-in registry. The OpenCodex
provider therefore emits `models` as a mapping keyed by the canonical namespaced selector. An
explicit catalog modality list containing `image` becomes `supports_vision: true`; an explicit,
non-empty list without `image` becomes `false`; an absent or empty modality list keeps an empty
model object so Hermes receives no guessed capability. OpenCodex does not emit `supports_video`
because its authoritative input-modality vocabulary currently has no video value.

## Ownership Axes

`fileFingerprint` records the exact whole-file result for restore and for serializers that may lose
comments. `blockFingerprint` records the exact generated contribution and detects catalog, model,
port, or provider drift. `fragmentPaths` bounds disable to the paths OpenCodex actually created.
New records pair the exact contribution fingerprints with semantic fingerprints that recursively
sort JSON object keys while preserving array order. Existing records without the semantic companion
fall back to comparing the recorded generated contribution when the catalog has not moved. This
keeps old records readable while preventing a client's formatting-only key reorder from
masquerading as a protected edit.

> Decision record: [ADR-0091](../decisions/ADR-0091-ownership-axes.md)

Clients normally protect every field in every recorded fragment. A client that writes documented,
runtime-derived fields back into an owned fragment may additionally record:

- `refreshablePaths`: the exact document paths that client may derive for this operation;
- `protectedBlockFingerprint`: the contribution fingerprint after only those paths are removed.

The paths are stored with the operation instead of recomputed from the latest catalog. That keeps a
later catalog expansion from silently widening what an older ownership record allows. Malformed or
incomplete policy records fail closed.

## ZCode Runtime Metadata

ZCode 3.8.1 persists model defaults into `provider.opencodex.models.*` after OpenCodex writes the
provider. The accepted derived paths are deliberately narrow:

- `reasoning` for model IDs emitted by that apply;
- `limit.output` for model IDs emitted by that apply;
- `limit.context` only when OpenCodex emitted no authoritative context for that model.

Provider identity and connection fields (`name`, `kind`, `enabled`, `source`, and every `options`
member), model membership, model names, modalities, and authoritative context limits remain
protected. Changing any of them stays `conflict / foreign-edit`.

Records written before the protected fingerprint existed can recover from ZCode-derived metadata
only while the desired contribution is still identical to the one recorded at apply time. If the
catalog also changed, the old record cannot distinguish catalog drift from a foreign edit and must
fail closed. A successful refresh writes the new operation-scoped policy.

## Verification

Behavior changes require real writer tests against a temporary home and state store. At minimum,
cover accepted derived metadata, protected connection edits, protected authoritative context,
catalog changes after a derived rewrite, and legacy-record fail-closed behavior. Synthetic
fingerprint-only tests are supplementary; they cannot prove the status and writer paths agree.

## Remote connection lifecycle

Remote clients journal and restore native integrations locally while model traffic travels directly to the hub. Catalog writes occur only after protocol negotiation and full remote schema validation. The management relay is launcher-scoped and fixed to the connection's management origin. Claude/Codex launch behavior remains integration-scoped. Key rotation and recovery align both the local connection credential and the connection-owned Desktop profile before reporting completion. Disconnect restores owned Desktop settings and native integrations locally without automatic hub-key revocation or usage mirroring. Interrupted cleanup remains recoverable for the same connection; conflicts prevent a full-cleanup claim.

## Local destinations on a hub

A client running on the proxy's own machine has two destinations, and they are resolved
separately by `src/lib/local-destinations.ts`. Inference (`localInferenceDestination`) is
`127.0.0.1` on the unauthenticated loopback listener's effective port when that listener is
enabled, otherwise the public port on the bind address — `127.0.0.1` for a loopback or wildcard
bind, and the tailnet or LAN address otherwise, where no loopback data socket exists at all. So
`ocx claude`, the `system-env` injection, the Claude Desktop profile, the Cursor gateway value,
the gateway-model cache, the routed vision self-fetch and the API-access loopback fallback all go
through that resolver rather than composing the port themselves. Management
(`localManagementOrigin`) is the hub's loopback `hub.managementIngress` when enabled, otherwise
the public bind address, and the caller supplies the management credential. `fetchClaudeCodeState`
is that resolver's caller: it sends the local admin token to the management ingress, or — with no
ingress — to the bind address, and either destination is host-local and never reaches an exported
client configuration. Management authentication has no loopback bypass and the data-loopback
listener serves no `/api/*`, so these two must never be collapsed into one base URL, and an admin
credential must never be written into an exported client configuration.

Both resolvers share the same fallback shape, and the inference one additionally reports whether
its destination demands data-plane admission: the loopback listener and a genuinely loopback bind
need no credential, while a wildcard or tailnet bind does. Each caller either attaches that
credential — the `OPENCODEX_API_AUTH_TOKEN` / service-token-file / `apiKeys` ladder, never the
admin token — or logs that it is degrading. Composing `http://127.0.0.1:<public port>` by hand is
what produced a dead socket on a tailnet-bound hub in the first place.

## Aside profile ownership

Aside discovery projects only registered numeric account IDs, labels and current status. Catalog
paths derive from the configured root/u/id, never from browser profilePath. Guarded filesystem
identity and IO apply to status and writes; internal resolved path pairs survive async freezing.

`asideProfileSync` owns desired all-profile defaults and per-profile overrides. The legacy
connection defaults all profiles on; explicit per-profile changes materialize that default and
pin one legacy root owner before changing it. Sibling stores remain independent. Policy saves
precede coordinated writes under one scoped flight, and actual file state/refusals remain
separate. Restore reconciles target intent from validated snapshot ownership without changing
sibling policy. Profile journal views retain source-store provenance for older legacy entries.

The shared atomic replacement publisher also identifies explicit Remote Workspace file writes as `remote-workspace`; its isolated owner and support limits are documented in [Remote Workspace](../remote-workspace.md).

## Cline paired files

Cline CLI uses `providers.json` for connection settings and sibling `models.json` for its
catalog. `src/integrations/cline-document.ts` separates native documents from raw-byte snapshot
bundles; `src/integrations/cline-io.ts` projects both files onto the existing writer/journal.
Only each file's `providers.opencodex` entry is owned. Schema envelopes and the user's default
provider remain user-owned. Cline's selected model and update timestamp can change during normal
use; refresh preserves a selection only while its model remains routed. Connection fields and
catalog membership remain protected.

Each file replacement is atomic; the pair is recoverable, not simultaneously visible. Stop Cline
before explicit enable/sync/disable/restore and restart afterward. Unattended refresh excludes
Cline. A private pending record precedes replacement and survives partial failure. Read-only
status reports an unfinished pair as unsafe; explicit mutation recovers only unchanged original
or intended bytes and compatible ownership. A journaled pair must match both intended files and
final ownership before pending cleanup. Foreign edits retain the pending evidence and refuse.
Undo restores both original byte strings, including individual file absence; drift requires the
existing explicit confirmation. The journal endpoint evaluates Undo against the same pair.

Recovery reads commit history and ownership through strict store methods. Unreadable or malformed
metadata is uncertainty, never evidence that a transaction did not commit. Pending records validate
complete ownership, exact Cline paths and result fingerprints before either native file is replaced.
