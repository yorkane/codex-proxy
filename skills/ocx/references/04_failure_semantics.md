# Failure semantics

What each exit code means, which failures are worth retrying, and which mean stop.

## Exit codes

`runCliAction` maps many management failures; the whole CLI does not share one
exit contract. Its common mappings and the main exceptions are:

| Code | Cause | Retry? |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | success | — |
| 2 | locally rejected usage in management handlers; also unsupported `doctor --json` | fix arguments |
| 64 | usage validation in `capabilities`, `ready`, `resolve` | fix arguments; no discovery/request for invalid input |
| 4 | HTTP 404 — the named account, provider, key, or route does not exist | no |
| 5 | HTTP 409 — conflict; a lock is held or state moved under you | inspect first; stale baselines require review |
| 1 | everything else: transport failure, 5xx, unexpected errors | depends on `reason` |

Two consequences worth internalizing:

**Exit 0 means no error was reported, not that a mutation happened.** Preview verbs
(`storage cleanup` without `--yes`) exit 0 after a read-only preview. Parse `--json` (or the
human summary) to see whether anything was written. Read saved/applied/skipped
fields and warnings as well; a successful save can leave live convergence pending.

**A local usage refusal is not a transport failure.** Fix the arguments rather than
retrying unchanged. Unknown root commands and unavailable explicit help topics use
exit 1; a capability route miss uses 4 even when an undeclared handler exists.

## Distinguishing "not running" from "failing"

```bash
ocx ready --json
```

Use readiness before live management. `pending` permits a bounded wait; `failed`
and `unreachable` need diagnosis. Offline help, local config and local Lab reads
still work without a proxy: do not start one just to perform those tasks. A ready
proxy can still refuse a route, serve an older version, or be the wrong role.
Check `status --json` and its `versionSkew` and target information.

A transport failure exits 1 and names the underlying cause (connection refused, DNS, TLS). Those
used to be indistinguishable; they are now reported separately, so read the message.

## Named reasons worth branching on

| Reason / code | HTTP | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `oauth_mutation_busy` | 503 | another credential write is in flight | wait `Retry-After` (1s), retry once |
| `catalog_busy` | 503 | a model-catalog gather is in flight | wait `Retry-After` (1s), retry once |
| config-mutation lock reason | 503 | a config write holds the lock | retry shortly |
| credential-conflict reason | — | the install is structurally broken | run `ocx doctor`; do NOT retry |
| `stale_preview` | 409 | a storage cleanup digest no longer matches | re-run the preview |
| `dest_exists` | 409 | a trash restore target already exists | resolve the file, then retry |
| `codex_busy` | 409 | Codex is holding `state.sqlite` | retry after Codex quits |
| `storage_mutation_busy` | 409 | another cleanup or restore is running | retry shortly |

The two 503s carry `Retry-After: 1` from the server, so the wait is specified rather than guessed.

The credential-conflict case is the one to stop on. It is not contention — it is a broken install,
and repeating the call produces the same error indefinitely.

## A retry policy that does not spin

1. Exit 2 or 64 → fix arguments. Never retry unchanged.
2. Exit 4 → distinguish a missing resource from a missing declaration. For a
   resource, list first (`account list`, `provider list`, `access key list`); for
   a declaration, consult family help. Do not retry the same lookup.
3. For a read or a confirmed pre-write contention refusal, wait the stated
   `Retry-After` interval and retry **once**. An exit 5 from provider apply or profile update requires
   fresh review, not a timed retry. Never repeat an uncertain or persisted write
   merely because its exit code is nonzero.
4. Exit 1 with a credential-conflict reason → run `ocx doctor` and report. Do not retry.
5. Exit 1 otherwise → read the message. A transport failure may be worth one retry; an unexpected
   5xx is worth reporting.

The rule behind all of it: retry contention, never retry a broken state. A loop that retries a
credential conflict looks like progress and produces nothing.

## Service and launchd semantics (macOS)

Two states that read as failures and are not. Both come from the same change: a repair of a
healthy job must not be an outage.

**`ocx service repair` printing `service is already loaded from the current plist; nothing to
do.` is success.** The repair renders the plist first and compares it. When the rendered
bytes match the file, the token file is unchanged, and `launchctl print` reports the job
loaded from that plist, launchd is not touched at all. Do not retry it, and do not escalate
to `ocx service uninstall`.

**`ocx service restart` is NOT an alias of `repair` — it always restarts.** It runs the same
refresh, and when nothing was reloaded (the healthy, unchanged job above) it restarts the
loaded job in place with `launchctl kickstart -k gui/<uid>/com.opencodex.proxy`, verifies the
job with the same probe, and prints `service restarted (launchctl kickstart -k …)`. So when a
restart is the actual requirement — after a change to `unauthenticatedLoopbackListener`,
`hostname` or `port` — tell the operator `ocx service restart`, not a hand-written launchctl
command. Linux restarts through `systemctl --user restart` and Windows stops then starts the
task, on either verb.

A bare `ocx service` still selects `repair`, so it will not bounce a healthy hub. Reserve
`ocx service repair` for a job loaded from an older plist, or not loaded at all.
`launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.opencodex.proxy` is still a correct manual fallback
and the failure path names it, but do not lead with it. `ocx restart` is a different verb
entirely: it restarts a proxy process, not the service the manager supervises.

`ocx service status` has four launchd verdicts, and only two of them call for a repair:

| Summary | Meaning | Repair? |
|---|---|---|
| `installed and loaded` | A domain answers and runs the command this plist bakes | no |
| `installed and loaded from an OLDER plist` | Running, from a definition that no longer matches | yes |
| `installed, not loaded` | Every domain answered "absent" — proof the job is gone | yes |
| `installed; launchd state could not be verified` | `launchctl` could not be asked | **no** |

The last row is the one to get right. It is not evidence the service is down: the command
itself recommends nothing, and a probe that could not run never marks a running proxy as
dead. Reporting it as "not loaded" is what used to send operators to repair a serving hub.
If the proxy answers `ocx ready`, the hub is up regardless of what the probe could see.

## A hub-gated skip is not a failure

`ocx sync`, `ocx sync-cache`, `ocx ensure` and `ocx restore back` on a `runtimeRole: "hub"`
can exit 0 having deliberately written nothing:

> This machine is a hub; it does not rewrite its own Codex/Grok/Claude configs unless
> unauthenticatedLoopbackListener is enabled.

That is the hub gate, not the operator's `clientIntegrations` toggle, and not a lock
conflict — there is nothing to retry. Either enable the listener and restart the proxy
(`ocx service restart` on a service install), or
report that this hub leaves its own clients native. Details:
[05_remote_hub.md](05_remote_hub.md#the-hub-gate-on-the-hubs-own-clients).

## Destructive verbs fail closed

`storage trash restore` and `storage policy run` exit 2 without `--yes` and send no mutating
request. `storage cleanup` without `--yes` previews and exits 0; only `--yes` deletes.

`storage cleanup` also refuses locally if the preview returned no digest, rather than sending an
empty one and getting a 400 that looks like a bug in the verb.

## What no exit code will give you

Starring the repository has no CLI verb and no failure code, because it has no CLI path at all. It
spends the user's GitHub identity and the server requires a dashboard session for exactly that
reason. `ocx inspect star` reads status; if starring is wanted, ask the user.


## Provider save and convergence failures

Live provider lifecycle, pacing and batch operations can return `success: true`
with a nonzero exit: the configuration was saved but `catalogRefresh` failed or
was skipped as busy, stale, refused or unavailable. Preserve both facts. Read back
with `ocx provider snapshot --json` (and pacing read for pacing changes), then
inspect the reported convergence issue. Do not resend an add/remove/apply to
repair catalog refresh. Null, absent or `not-requested` refresh does not mean
client synchronization occurred, even when the command exits 0.

Local add with `--sync --json` also really attempts synchronization after saving.
No running proxy returns `sync.status: "not-running"`, `sync.ok: false`,
`needsSync: true`, and exit 1. Refused or failed sync is nonzero too; no rollback
is implied. Applied sync clears `needsSync`; policy-skipped and catalog-only
outcomes leave it true. JSON is an output choice, not a dry-run flag.

A stale batch baseline returns HTTP 409 / exit 5. Obtain a fresh snapshot from the
same intended host/context, compare concurrent changes, and rebuild the next
document for review. Do not silently replace the baseline, auto-rebase, or retry.
Pacing scalar PATCH has no baseline check and can overwrite a concurrent edit;
use snapshot/apply for compare-and-swap. Batch removal requires `--yes` and does
not include single-provider DELETE's OAuth account cleanup.

Invalid/oversized input, interactive stdin, missing removal confirmation and
conflicting flags return exit 2 before mutation. Files must be regular UTF-8 JSON;
each read has a 4 MiB cap and 30-second deadline, and the combined batch request
also has a 4 MiB cap. Fix the input rather than retrying unchanged. Provider errors
use fixed safe messages and never expose arbitrary nested server bodies. An
unusable receipt or transport failure can mean the write outcome is unknown:
inspect the target rather than claiming rollback or trying a local fallback.

## Model and routing recovery

Local custom-model saves have opportunistic sync: no proxy yields
`sync.status: "not-attempted"`, `needsSync: true` and exit 0. Do not confuse this
with an explicitly requested provider `--sync` failing because no proxy exists.
Attempted failed/refused/incomplete custom-model sync returns nonzero after saving;
policy-skipped success can still exit 0 while needing sync. Local JSON removal
requires `--yes`; live removal always requires it and never falls back locally.

New live custom, picker, display-name and profile writes, plus combo set, return
1 with the saved receipt when catalog refresh is skipped, failed or degraded.
Display-name can recognize HTTP 503 with `saved: true` and failed refresh as this
partial result. Inspect current state; a nonzero exit does not mean rollback.
Other errors print fixed stderr messages, not JSON error envelopes. Unknown write
outcomes must not trigger automatic repetition.

For manual picker order, supply each routed public ID exactly once with the
required featured prefix. Native-inclusive saved order requires an explicit
reset/default decision before replacement; do not reset merely to suppress a
refusal. A changed observation before PUT returns 409/exit 5. Re-read status and
identities, review the list and resubmit only the intended edit. This recheck is
not CAS. Most-used refuses incomplete usage rather than ranking missing data as zero.

Profile update requires the original explicit revision and an editable-only
file. A 409/exit 5 means read show again and review concurrent changes; never
silently substitute a fresh revision, retry, or fall back to create. Create/update
may activate Lab and enabled automation, including upstream probes, so retrying
is not an observational operation. Deletion has no revision protection.

Combo target files cannot be combined with `--targets`. An incompatible retained
native alias can make `--native-alias off` refuse; clear that alias too only if
that is the intended change. `set` is an upsert without CAS. Statistics with
incomplete history can exit 0: preserve coverage limits and nullable measurements;
never convert the report into unsupported cost or savings claims.

## Account, settings and v2 boundaries

Unsupported pool fields or conflicting account selectors refuse before writing.
Null stored policy, effective state and inert pooling are different; do not turn
null into false or retry an unsupported setting. OpenAI per-account auto-switch
requires `--account`; omission retains pool scope. Unavailable quota activation
may return 409: inspect window availability, never enable paid credits or consume
a reset grant as recovery. Anthropic grant GET may read upstream but never spends.

Login options depend on the actual flow. Device-only browser flags, add-account
on reauth/Codex, or either new flag on native Kiro `--method` refuse before login.
Preserve flow identity on cancellation/expiry; do not restart or verify automatically.
Live OAuth logout failure never authorizes local credential deletion.

Memory/compaction set replaces a full block, not just supplied phase/scope fields.
Memory `{}` or clear/null restores existing routing without disabling the pipeline;
compaction clear restores ordinary compaction. Read back before fixing an unintended
scope. A settings write can be accepted yet return pending/unverified and exit 1.
Missing Ultra Fast read-back must remain unverified. Sidecar saved state and native
apply are separate; inspect ownership rather than replaying a refused apply.

v2 parse failures preserve local exit 1 and live exit 2. Advisory acknowledgment
is accepted only for explicit live mode; never auto-ack to bypass refusal. A 502
from live v2 may mean partial native application, not rollback. Local sync can
actually run without a discovered proxy port; void/malformed evidence exits 1 as
unverified. Inspect `v2 status` on the same local/live target before recovery.
Unknown state, saved state and client convergence must remain separate.

## Integration and maintenance recovery

Preview is an observation: valid refused/no-op plans exit 0. Read `canApply`,
`willChange` and refusal reason before choosing a write. Never auto-confirm drift,
overwrite a conflict, or treat a fingerprint as permission. An unbound refusal
fingerprint cannot commit. A stale bound write exits 5, leaves stdout empty and
prints a fixed re-preview instruction on stderr; preserve the exact original
client/action/profile/opId/default-map/drift intent when preparing a new preview.
Do not adopt a replacement fingerprint automatically. Syntax errors exit 2,
not-found 4, malformed/runtime failures 1. Preview needs passive catalog evidence;
unavailability does not trigger a provider refresh inside the command.

History deletion is irreversible. The latest recovery row is protected. If a
receipt says `snapshotRemoved:false`, the row is already retired and exit is 1;
inspect before further cleanup, never claim rollback or repeat deletion. Aside
sync empty results mean no eligible profiles; partial results leave successful
writes intact and exit 1. There is no profile selector, local-write fallback or
broad-sync fallback for that command. Preserve residual and redacted backup facts.

Runtime Desktop import saves only and retains server conflict/availability/applied
marker checks. On refusal, do not import locally or apply native state as a fallback.
Cursor installer unavailable is a valid read even with null reason; no download,
installation or trust change follows automatically.

Hub activation off can return outer HTTP 200 with `available:false`: the CLI emits
that narrow observation and exits 1. It is not an available empty Hub. Inner 409
is exit 5; client-role, transport and malformed replies remain failures. Inspect
the intended Hub and its activation setting without automatically changing them.

Storage target forms conflict; omitted enable remains unchanged and set does not
run cleanup. Forced link revoke requires `--force --yes`. Success reports remote
cleanup skipped, and idempotent not-found reports it unverified; neither confirms
an attempted remote disconnect. Review the remote-client disconnect recovery
separately. Do not interpret exit 0 as proof that all remote state was removed.

## Filtered observation recovery

`logs filter` rejects follow/events, conflicting outputs, unknown/repeated flags
and invalid bounds before discovery. Empty matches are a successful observation
of the scanned window. Malformed or oversized replies and transport failures are
nonzero, never an empty success. Reduce `--scan-limit` for an oversized snapshot;
reducing `--limit` alone cannot reduce the fetched window. No automatic history
scan or retry occurs.

`usage --search` is local model-row selection after the scoped read. A search
miss leaves report totals intact; `filter.matched:false` and incomplete-history
markers remain independent. Invalid model data must not be read as no matches.
Omit search to recover the existing report layout, not to change authorization.

`companion usage` retains available ranges when another range fails, prints a
fixed partial-failure diagnostic and exits 1. Do not sum unavailable data as zero.
Valid server defaults from a corrupt settings file remain usable but visibly
flagged; malformed settings stop before usage reads. Each settings/range GET has
its own 10-second fetch/body deadline after discovery and 32 MiB body bound;
these are not a 10-second whole-command promise. Signals exit 130/143 without
late output. A retry is a new observation, not an atomic continuation.

API-key `account list --quota` distinguishes unsupported, passive, unmeasured and
unavailable readings. Missing quota-mode evidence on a returned key row is
unverified/nonzero; invalid consumed fields fail instead of becoming zero.
`--refresh` bypasses the existing quota cache only when quota was requested.
Do not loop on failed probes: explicit quota reads may contact providers.

## Observation and selected-key recovery

Follow usage errors exit 2. Request/injection follow failures stop with fixed stderr
and exit 1; they do not silently truncate, retry or reconnect. A 32 MiB window
refusal suggests reducing `--limit`. Detected runtime drift requires an explicit
restart of follow. Ctrl-C/SIGINT exits 130, SIGTERM 143, without subsequent polls
or output. Retained rows are observations, not proof of a complete history. Use
log events for resets/removals; legacy row JSONL cannot reconstruct them. Injection
has no epoch/gap indicator and cannot promise lossless restart recovery.

Timeline exclusions use `--hide-provider`; `--provider` is unsupported. Stale or
future bucket windows fail instead of appearing as current usage; only the
request-time end or its immediate successor after a rollover is accepted. Read the
applied filter acknowledgment and incomplete evidence rather than retrying a zero
plot as a fault. Management health can report status ok with degraded spendLedger;
liveness and subsystem readiness are different. Key-scoped usage refuses an
unacknowledged filter; connected clients reject the flag before enrolled-key access
or network. Unknown acknowledged IDs can legitimately match nothing.

Rename accepts only a unique key identity/name and a valid new label. Usage or
ambiguous/missing selector exits 2; an unconfirmed write exits 1 with fixed stderr.
Re-list masked state before retrying. It never rotates keys or broadens scopes.

Selected-key model/audio input is explicit bounded stdin in the operator's private
terminal. Invalid grammar/input exits 2 before a data request; input timeout or
operation/target/HTTP/response-size/schema failure exits 1. Never repair failure by using an
admin/enrolled credential, another protocol, another origin, automatic key capture
or a repeated paid request/upload. Model tests only advance after exact native
credential-required 401; authless/unrecognized control means verification unavailable,
not a broken key. Chosen-key JSON operational failure preserves the versioned
observations with fixed stderr. Unkeyed legacy JSON remains the original payload.

A usable limited model reply is visibly limited, not unsupported. Refusal, content
filter, tool-only or malformed replies cannot establish success. Even a success
report cannot certify atomic key admission, scope or billing identity. Only exact
key occurrences in permitted text are redacted, not every possible encoding.

Transcription failure prints no stdout, only fixed stderr/nonzero; successful JSON
is `{text}`. Do not re-upload automatically. Live-check operational failures retain
the ready/close DTO; readiness plus unverified close is partial/exit 1. A normal
close after earlier failure is still failure. No raw frames/errors or credential
carriers are exposed. Timeouts and cancellation close local resources without
proving upstream lease release or absence of cost. Signals return 130/143.

## Local config failures

`config validate` exits 1 for an invalid config, including in JSON mode (`{ok:false,error}`). `config`, `config show`, and `config get` warn on stderr and exit nonzero when displaying fallback defaults. Use `config validate` to inspect the failure or `config show --source` for an explicit diagnostic read; that read may exit 0 while reporting `source: "fallback"` and a warning.

Local `provider add` validates the complete candidate before saving. A refused destination leaves config bytes unchanged. Add `--allow-private-network` only for an intentionally local provider; blocked metadata endpoints remain forbidden. `health` accepts only one optional `--json`; other arguments exit 2 before discovery. Alias usage failures also exit 2.

File `config export --json` emits only `{ok:true,path}`; the requested file contains raw credentials. Export to `-` always remains a raw config document and must stay out of agent transcripts.
