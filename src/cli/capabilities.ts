/**
 * What `ocx` can do, as data an agent can read without parsing help text.
 *
 * This is the machine-readable index behind `ocx capabilities`. It relates each CLI
 * capability to the management route(s) it drives, which nothing in this repository did
 * before: help lived in twenty per-module `USAGE` constants and a hand-written banner
 * that a test explicitly licensed to drift from the command registry.
 *
 * LEAF MODULE. It imports nothing from `src/cli/`, and nothing here may import a command
 * module. That is not tidiness. Each command module declares its usage text as a
 * top-level `const USAGE`, evaluated at import time, so a cycle back into this table
 * would resolve to `undefined` under ESM rather than throwing -- silently emptying the
 * usage text that `rejectArgs` hands to `CliUsageError`, in the exact error-reporting
 * surface the CLI-operability issues are about. `tests/cli-capabilities.test.ts` asserts
 * the absence of those imports and that every rendered usage string is non-empty, so the
 * failure mode is loud instead of degraded.
 *
 * Head-handled surfaces (`--version`, `help`) are declared separately in
 * `HEAD_CAPABILITIES`. They exit in the CLI head (`root.ts`) before dispatch and have no
 * runner key, so listing them as ordinary capabilities would break the registry parity
 * assertion that every canonical entry is a direct runner. `help` is excluded from
 * `CLI_COMMANDS` deliberately -- `tests/cli-registry.test.ts` documents it as a
 * head-handled pseudo-case -- and that decision is preserved here rather than reversed.
