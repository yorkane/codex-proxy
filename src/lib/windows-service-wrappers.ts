/**
 * Shared termination of surviving Windows scheduler launcher/wrapper processes.
 *
 * `schtasks /end` ends the task instance but often leaves wscript/cmd running the
 * `:loop` batch, which brings the proxy back during a stop, a restart, or
 * post-update reclaim. Both the service teardown path and the update job need
 * that guarantee, and they used to carry a copy each.
 *
 * The copies drifted in both directions, which is why this module exists rather
 * than a second careful implementation: the updater received the #1589 argv
 * cleanup that service.ts missed, and service.ts received the canonical-path
 * scoping the updater missed. One of those gaps could force-terminate a wrapper
 * belonging to a DIFFERENT OpenCodex home.
 *
 * Matching is scoped to the CANONICAL paths of one installation, never a bare
 * filename, and the path must appear as a COMPLETE command-line token
 * (wscript.exe spawns the .vbs as an argument; cmd.exe /c runs the .cmd). A
 * substring match is excluded: an unrelated process whose command line merely
 * contains the filename, and a wrapper under another home whose path ends with
 * the same name, must both survive.
