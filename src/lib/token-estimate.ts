/**
 * Heuristic token-estimation sidecar.
 *
 * Some providers (notably kiro / CodeWhisperer) return no token usage in their stream, so Codex's
 * usage display and auto-compact (which read response.completed.usage) never engage. This module
 * provides a cheap, dependency-free char-based estimate to fill that gap.
 *
 * Grounding (web): 1 token ~= 4 chars for English prose; empirical model ratios are ~Claude 3.5,
 * ~GPT 3.6, ~Gemini 3.8 chars/token (within ~10%). Code / JSON / tool-args (the dominant Codex
 * traffic) pack MORE tokens per char, so a lower chars-per-token ratio is used for those models.
 * Over-counting fails safe (auto-compact fires earlier); under-counting risks context overflow.
 *
 * ## Why the estimate is segmented by script rather than a single divisor
 *
 * A single chars-per-token divisor cannot describe mixed text. Latin prose and code run near
 * 3.2 chars/token; Hangul and Han run near 1.2-1.5, because a Latin-trained BPE spends a token
 * on roughly every CJK character. That is a ~2.5x spread inside one blob, and essentially all
 * real agent traffic is mixed: English code and JSON framing with Korean prose threaded through
 * it.
 *
 * The earlier model divided the whole blob by one ratio and then clamped to a denser ratio only
 * when a SAMPLED CJK share crossed 30%. Two failures followed from that shape. The clamp was a
 * cliff: 29% CJK counted at the sparse ratio, 31% at the dense one, and the band where real
 * traffic actually sits (roughly 1-30% CJK) never triggered it at all. And the sampler read
 * every stride-th character on long blobs, so the share it measured was noisy — a payload of
 * fixed-width records could sample as 100% CJK while being 1.6% CJK, a case still documented in
 * `server/responses/input-admission.ts`.
 *
 * Counting the two scripts separately and adding them removes both problems at once. There is no
 * threshold to sit beside, no sampling error, and the result is continuous in the CJK share, so a
 * blob that gains one Korean character gains a fraction of a token instead of jumping a ratio.

 *
 * Measured two independent ways, which agree. Recorded conversations pair exact text with the
 * provider's authoritative input-token count; over 5,799 pure-Latin samples that aggregates to
 * 2.80 chars/token. Separately, recorded Kiro request bodies charge ~2.43 bytes per token, and
 * those bodies run ~1.12 bytes per counted character of JSON escaping and framing, which implies
 * ~2.17 chars/token at the wire.
 *
 * 2.8 takes the conservative end of that pair. All kiro models are text LLMs, so one Latin ratio
 * applies to the whole family.
 *

 * admission ceilings, `count_tokens` answers, and overflow-vs-429 classification. Widening a
