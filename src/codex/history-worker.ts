/**
 * Worker-thread entry for the Codex history unit.
 *
 * Everything mutable about history happens here, behind H: the SQLite rows, the
 * backup manifest, and every rollout patch. Those three do not share a
 * transaction — sync writes the manifest before its database transaction, and
 * restore preflights every rollout, applies database CAS before rollout changes inside one
 * SQLite transaction, then consumes the manifest after exact readback — so a busy timeout only
 * ever serialized a third of a state transition. Holding H across the whole unit
 * is what stops an opposite-direction process overtaking through the other two.
 *
 * The message is deliberately thin, and it does NOT carry a direction. A caller
 * saying which way history should move is exactly what the durable operation
 * exists to prevent: `syncResumeHistory: false` means leave history alone, apply
 * targets opencodex only in legacy mode, and legacy recovery is a different
 * operation from generic restore. So the Worker is told which JOB to run and
 * reads the operation from the coordinator row itself.
 *
 * Homes are carried explicitly because a Worker is a separate process: it does
 * not inherit the module-load `CODEX_HOME` that `history-provider.ts` resolves
 * at import time, so a request that leaned on those constants would silently
 * address the wrong home.
 *
 * Design record: devlog/_fin/260804_codex_write_substrate/020_history_isolation.md.
