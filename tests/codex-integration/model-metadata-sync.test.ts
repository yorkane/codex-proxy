/**
 * `src/generated/model-metadata.ts` is generated from the vendored snapshot
 * `scripts/model-metadata.source.json`, and until now nothing checked that the committed file
 * still matched its source. It drifted by 95 models — 148 price fields, 36 context windows, 45
 * maxTokens, and 36 entirely new models — which meant a routine regeneration would sweep all of
 * that into cost accounting alongside whatever the author actually intended to change.
 *
 * This guard closes that. It regenerates into a temp directory and byte-compares, so it can never
 * clobber the committed file. The snapshot ships in this repository, so the guard runs
 * everywhere, including CI. Refreshing the metadata is one deliberate commit: replace the
 * snapshot and rerun `bun run generate:model-metadata`.
