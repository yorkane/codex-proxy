/**
 * Reconciles the declared route registry against source, in three directions.
 *
 * Why three, and why none of them is sufficient alone -- stated here because the
 * original plan for this gate specified ONE mechanism that could not work, and a future
 * reader is otherwise likely to "simplify" it back:
 *
 * 1. SOURCE -> REGISTRY. Every `(method, path)` pair resolvable from source must be
 *    declared. Catches an added route. Cannot see the 18 routes registered by regex,
 *    `endsWith`, `slice`, prefix decode, or a path constant.
 * 2. REGISTRY -> SOURCE. Every declared literal route's path must appear in its declared
 *    owner file. Catches a typo or a stale declaration. Cannot hold for the 18
 *    non-literal routes, whose paths contain `{param}` placeholders that appear nowhere.
 * 3. PER-MODULE RECONCILIATION. For each module, declared count must equal scanned pairs
 *    plus declared non-literal routes. This is the one that catches an UNDER-declared
 *    registry: a route omitted from the registry AND invisible to check 1 is invisible
 *    to both other checks, and that is precisely where a gate passes vacuously.
 *
 * The reconciliation counts `(method, path)` PAIRS, never `rg` line hits. Line counting
 * cannot balance: one guard registers two routes when it reads `PUT || PATCH`, nineteen
 * path guards decide their method in a preceding sibling guard or a nested one, and two
 * live routes are written `pathname !== "…"` so an equality scan never sees them. One
 * module has one route and zero equality literals.
 *
 * The scanner fails loud: a path guard whose method it cannot resolve comes back with
 * `method: null` and test 4 fails on it. It never assumes GET.
