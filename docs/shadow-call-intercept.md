# Shadow Call Intercept

## What are shadow calls?

Codex Desktop App makes background API calls with a hard-coded helper model for internal tasks:

- **Thread title generation** — auto-generates 3-8 word titles after your first prompt
- **Commit message generation** — generates git commit messages
- **Skill orchestration** — internal orchestration turns

These calls happen independently of your selected main model. When intercepted, the request keeps
its configured reasoning effort.

The helper model is not stable across client versions. Codex used `gpt-5.4-mini` up to 0.144.x and
moved to `gpt-5.6-luna` in 0.145.0, which silently disabled a single-literal intercept
([#311](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/issues/311)). The intercept therefore matches a
**set** of source-model prefixes — `gpt-5.6-luna` by default — so a client bump does not quietly
turn the feature off. `gpt-5.4-mini` is retired upstream and is no longer a default prefix, but it
remains a valid `sourceModels` entry for anyone still serving 0.144.x clients. Routed ids
(`provider/model`) are never matched: a shadow call is always a bare native slug, and an explicit
routed selection must not be hijacked.

## The problem

- Non-OpenAI providers (Bedrock, Azure, etc.) may not support the bare helper slug, causing 404 errors
- Users have no control over which model handles these helper tasks
- Shadow calls consume API quota without user awareness

## Configuration

### Via Dashboard UI

1. Open the opencodex dashboard
2. Find the "Shadow Call Intercept" panel
3. Toggle the switch to enable
4. Enter a replacement model (e.g., `gpt-5.5`)

The panel badge and tooltip render the source models the running proxy actually intercepts, read
from `GET /api/shadow-call-settings` (`sourceModels`), so the UI never names a stale slug.

### Via config.json

```json
{
  "shadowCallIntercept": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "gpt-5.5"
  }
}
```

`sourceModels` is an optional override. When set to a non-empty array of strings it **replaces**
the defaults rather than extending them:

```json
{
  "shadowCallIntercept": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "gpt-5.5",
    "sourceModels": ["gpt-5.6-luna"]
  }
}
```

### Behavior

- Every request whose bare model id matches a configured source prefix is rewritten to the
  configured model, including normal `request_kind: "turn"` requests and maintenance requests
  such as `prewarm`, `compaction`, and `memory`
- `x-codex-turn-metadata` does not exempt a matching request from interception
- The request's configured reasoning effort is preserved
- The original model ID is logged as `shadowCallRewrittenFrom` in request logs
- When disabled (default), no interception occurs

### Warning

Interception is model-based and does not distinguish foreground turns from background helper calls.
If a client uses `gpt-5.6-luna` as its main model, narrow `sourceModels` or disable the intercept.
