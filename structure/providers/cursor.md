# Cursor Provider

The configuration-only [plaintext V2 contract](../subagents.md#plaintext-v2-agent-messages)
is scoped to canonical ChatGPT Responses forwarding; other source-area behavior described here is unchanged.

Codex-native retirement does not retire a Cursor-owned model name. Cursor transport and
namespace handling retain their provider contract; the bounded native scope lives in
[the shared catalog](../catalog.md#shared-catalog).

Cursor's direct adapter does not enter the OpenAI Chat serializer's
[OpenCode Go instruction ordering](chat-compat.md#opencode-go-chronological-instructions).

Shared parsing and streaming follow the [request-copy](../transports/byte-accounting.md#request-copy-accounting) and [stream-buffer accounting](../transports/byte-accounting.md#stream-buffer-accounting) contracts.

## Cursor Native Exec

Cursor's experimental live transport can receive server-driven local read/write/delete/ls/grep,
shell, and fetch exec frames. These frames are denied by default because they bypass Codex's normal
approval and sandbox path. `nativeLocalExec: "on"` is the explicit config-owner opt-in for trusted
local experiments; `off` and the backwards-compatible `codex-sandbox` spelling both fail closed.
MCP, screen recording, and computer-use stay on their separate explicit executor/MCP config paths.

> Decision record: [ADR-0047](../decisions/ADR-0047-cursor-native-exec.md)

Cursor's generic tool-use prompt filter must preserve every Responses-owned execution-path tool
that survives the transport budget: unified Desktop `exec` as well as the legacy
`exec_command`/`shell_command` aliases. The legacy aliases receive Cursor-specific shell guidance;
unified `exec` keeps its own schema and is surfaced back to Codex as a client tool. It must never
fall through to the separate native-local-exec dispatcher.

In external Cursor turns using code mode or shell aliases, the bounded leading-commentary guard in `src/adapters/cursor/envelope-echo.ts` counts `Shell`, `네이티브 셸`, and `네이티브 쉘` as one `shell` identity, including spacing variants and names split across text deltas. Korean aliases require a Unicode-aware left token boundary so wording embedded in a larger word or identifier is not counted; punctuation and following Korean grammatical suffixes remain supported. Rejection still requires a failure claim plus either an explicit redirect or at least two distinct native-tool identities; repeated aliases alone do not count as multiple tools.

## Cursor parameterized models

Cursor Router's parameterized `default` model is represented in Codex by four catalog rows:
`cursor/auto` preserves Cursor's team/account default, while `cursor/auto-cost`,
`cursor/auto-balance`, and `cursor/auto-intelligence` make each optimization level explicit.
All four route to the `default` Cursor wire model. Explicit variants additionally populate
`AgentRunRequest.requested_model.parameters` with the `optimization` parameter; this is the same
parameterized-model channel used by current Cursor clients. Router rows are static capabilities and
must survive a live `GetUsableModels` response that omits `default`.

`cursor/grok-4.5-fast` and `cursor/grok-4.6-fast` are stable Codex-facing rows, but current Cursor
clients do not request them as flat model slugs. OpenCodex sends the matching Grok base id through
`requested_model` with separate `effort` and `fast=true` parameters, leaving legacy `model_details`
unset for that parameterized external selection. Grok 4.5 stops at `high`; Grok 4.6 additionally
advertises and sends `xhigh`. Live discovery recognizes Cursor's flattened
`cursor-grok-{version}-{effort}-fast` variants, plus the older
`grok-{version}-fast-{effort}` ordering, as availability evidence only.

## Cursor live discovery is seed-gated

`filterCursorConfiguredModelsByLiveDiscovery` filters the configured roster by live
availability; it does not union live ids into the catalog. A wire id `GetUsableModels`
advertises but no capability base claims is therefore invisible to the picker, however many
effort variants the roster carries. That is deliberate — Cursor advertises ids whose every
`Run` returns `not_found`, which is what `CURSOR_KNOWN_UNCALLABLE_MODEL_IDS` and the
variant-level quarantine exist for — so a new family is admitted by adding its capability row,
not by relaxing the filter.

Synthetic ultra rows (`<base>-1m` markers such as `kimi-k3-1m`, kept in `configured` by legacy
pins or retain lists) clear that base-availability check and one more: the live roster must flag
Max Mode for the base (`GetUsableModels.maxMode`), or the row stays hidden. Base availability
alone is not enough — an account on a plan without Max Mode would otherwise see a row whose
ultra request it cannot serve.

A seeded ladder carries only rungs supported by vendor evidence. `muse-spark-1.3` is seeded at
`minimal` through `xhigh` even though Cursor's roster also advertises `muse-spark-1.3-max`:
Meta publishes no `max` rung for Muse Spark and an independent probe rejected it, both already
recorded on `META_MUSE_REASONING_EFFORTS`. A reseller advertising a wire id is not evidence the
wire accepts it, so a Codex request at `max` clamps to `xhigh` rather than sending a rung two
sources say does not exist.

## Cursor active-context usage

Cursor's `conversationCheckpointUpdate.tokenDetails.usedTokens` is treated as the authoritative
absolute active-context size for a Cursor conversation. Some client-tool suspension turns must end
before Cursor emits a new checkpoint; those turns carry forward the last observed total for the same
Cursor conversation instead of reporting only the tiny current-turn output delta. The carry-forward
cache is process-local, numeric-only, bounded, and keyed by Cursor conversation id. Compaction
boundaries clear the carry so pre-compaction totals are not reused after Codex replaces history.
Historical compaction markers restored by `previous_response_id` expansion are acknowledged as a
replayed prefix and do not clear a fresh post-compaction checkpoint again on every later turn.
Compaction summarizer turns may still report their own checkpoint for that response, but their
pre-compaction checkpoint is not persisted for later carry-forward.

> Decision record: [ADR-0053](../decisions/ADR-0053-cursor-active-context-usage.md)

## Cursor conversation checkpoint reuse

After a successful no-tool turn, the Cursor adapter keeps the returned ConversationStateStructure in
a process-local store and reuses that snapshot on the next validated linear continuation instead of
rebuilding rootPromptMessagesJson and conversationTurns. Tool-result turns reuse the last completed
checkpoint plus only the uncovered suffix. A request without checkpointRef may use the prefix index
only when a remembered Cursor conversation or stable client thread owns the resolved conversation id.
The stable owner may be the Codex parent-thread header or the existing bounded process-local HMAC of
the complete Desktop session-id/thread-id pair. The request must also have a covered message prefix
and system/developer digest that match exactly one snapshot for that same
conversation. Headerless requests without a stable owner full-replay. Isolated helper/shadow turns
never join the parent or sibling conversation. An explicit missing checkpointRef full-replays. Compaction, account or model mismatch, missing refs, decode failures, and
invalid_argument recovery keep the existing full-replay path. previous_response_id may select a
branch's opaque checkpointRef; it is never a Cursor conversation ownership key. Cursor Connect still
does not expose authoritative cache_read_tokens.

## Cursor root replay budgets

`src/adapters/cursor/protobuf-request.ts` bounds the replayed root set at 192 blobs and 512 KiB, and
caps the serialized arguments named inside one replayed tool-result envelope at 2 KiB. That per-call
cap is what keeps a 600 KiB argument from consuming the aggregate budget and evicting the output it
describes, and it still decides admission. Because it is charged while the envelope is being built,
a small replay would otherwise clip a completed call's arguments with nearly the whole envelope
unused. After every pruning and truncation decision is final, a second pass re-widens clipped
invocation lines out of the leftover aggregate bytes only: newest tool result first, skipping a root
whose own output was already elided, and never dropping, shrinking or reordering a retained root.
The elision skip is load bearing, reached through initiator recovery rather than through truncation
alone: a truncated root undershoots its own budget by far less than a restoration costs, but after
the equal-share pass elides a trailing run, recovery drops an elided sibling to fit the user turn and
the freed bytes become spare. It requires the share to land in a narrow window where the clipped
invocation line survives but `output:` does not; outside that window the clipped-line lookup declines
the root first.
Root-echo eligibility is `cursorNeedsExternalToolContinuation`, which includes native
`composer-2.5`, not only external wire models, so the restoration reaches every replay that carries
an invocation line. Coverage lives in
`tests/providers/cursor/cursor-tool-result-invocation.test.ts`.

## Cursor executable tool schema ownership

`src/adapters/cursor/tool-schemas.ts` owns advertised and argument-normalization
schemas; `tool-definitions.ts` remains the public facade and protobuf encoder.
Advertisement and normalization intentionally differ for shell bridges: Cursor may
emit `cmd`, while the declared Responses contract decides whether it becomes
`command`. Both paths preserve execution-control fields. Freeform tools use one
required string `input` in a closed object, retaining that tool's string-valued
input description from the parser (including patch-envelope guidance). Other input
constraints cannot widen the canonical shape. Bare shell bridge names are rejected
on the freeform path.
Namespaced tools do not acquire bare-shell behavior. Regression coverage lives in
`tests/providers/cursor/cursor-tool-definitions.test.ts`.

Google's [tool-schema loss report](google.md#google-tool-schema-loss-reporting) is confined to the
Google final compiler and does not change Cursor's advertised or normalized schema ownership.

Canonical Spark Lite metadata follows the final serialized model and surviving nonempty Lite tool catalog; see [Responses transport](../transports/responses.md).

Shared raw-reasoning events retain content-channel presentation; provider-authored thinking keeps its existing summary path. See [bridge contract](chat-compat.md).

Combo child requests normalize effort and thinking controls against the selected target while retaining reasoning summaries; strict unknown targets preserve caller controls. The [Responses transport owner](../transports/responses.md) documents this boundary, and native Chat removes effort only for an explicit empty declaration or no-reasoning model.

## Textual pseudo tool-call quarantine

Cursor models sometimes emit `[TOOL_CALL]name[ARGS]{…}` inside `textDelta` instead of a
real `toolCall*` frame. `src/adapters/cursor/text-toolcall.ts` strips every complete
marker from the assistant text channel and yields the parsed name/args. It retains split
markers up to a byte-counted cap, then switches to a constant-space suppressed scan until
the JSON object closes; neither an oversized tail nor a malformed payload returns to prose.
Malformed argument diagnostics contain only the failure class and an optional tool name,
never the argument content. `src/adapters/cursor/protobuf-events.ts` buffers advertised textual calls
until turn finalization. It flushes them onto the atomic tool-call path only when the turn
contained no real client-tool frame; any real frame, including one left incomplete, wins and
drops the whole textual buffer. A missing advertised-name set is fail-closed. Finalize also
clears any held or suppressed prefix. Coverage lives in
`tests/providers/cursor/cursor-protobuf-events.test.ts`.

## Observed checkpoint window

`conversationCheckpointUpdate.tokenDetails.maxTokens` is the account-advertised
ceiling for that wire model. A positive value is stored in a process-local map
keyed by the normalized Cursor identity scope and model id
(`src/adapters/cursor/discovery.ts`) and preferred by `inferCursorContextWindow`
only for that scope. Missing scopes normalize to the distinct `local` scope, so
they cannot inherit an authenticated account's observation. The map evicts its
oldest insertion above 2,048 entries. Zero and missing values are ignored — the
first checkpoint is often 0. The next turn's
`cursorRequestSizeContext` feeds that window into the existing 0.5-window
overflow vs 429 prior so a tiny request against a plan-gated 32k ceiling stays
on the 429 class, while a request that is large relative to the real window
classifies as overflow. Coverage lives in
`tests/providers/cursor/cursor-errors.test.ts` and
`tests/providers/cursor/cursor-protobuf-events.test.ts`.

## Overflow remint boundary

`src/adapters/cursor.ts` surfaces the first bare context overflow before attempting conversation remint on later eligible requests. `cursorClientThreadOwner` recognizes both client thread aliases; `src/adapters/cursor/thread-continuity.ts` limits recovery to three remints per retained identity-scoped owner, with a one-hour idle TTL and 2,048-entry bound. Conversation-only requests have no stable owner and do not automatically remint. Quota/rate errors, tool-result resumes, partial output, local side effects, isolated helper/shadow requests and compaction remain fail-closed. Isolated requests neither consume the parent allowance nor invalidate its checkpoint. Eligible overflow checks refresh existing retention timestamps and LRU position even after the cap is exhausted, without allocating absent scopes. Retention expiry, eviction or process restart resets the in-memory allowance; this is not a persistent lifetime cap or semantic-progress policy.

An incomplete client-tool stream is fail-closed for the current turn: `finalizeTurnEvents` emits the prefix owned by `CURSOR_INCOMPLETE_TOOL_CALL_MESSAGE_PREFIX` and does not retry that send. After the error is streamed, eligible non-isolated turns remint the Cursor conversation id, persist the thread override, and invalidate the inherited checkpoint so the next turn does not resume a conversation left waiting for `mcpResult`. `src/adapters/cursor/thread-continuity.ts` permits three such rotations per retained identity-scoped thread owner in a separate bounded counter; exhaustion keeps reusing the conversation and records an `incomplete-tool-remint-exhausted` diagnostic, while a clean completed turn clears that scope's counter. This allowance never consumes or replenishes the overflow resend budget. Isolated helper and compaction turns neither remint nor change the parent's allowance or checkpoint. Native Composer replay synthesizes `[missing tool_result for this tool_use in history]` for unpaired `toolCallStep` history; external wire models skip native `mcpToolCall` replay, so conversation remint is their recovery path.

Translated Chat request construction uses the [inline-image budget](../transports/streaming-health.md#translated-chat-inline-image-budget); the shared normalizer counts retained bytes even when a wire-specific drop callback keeps the image attached, rejects inputs above the safe decoded-pixel ceiling, caps native decode work process-wide, and stops queued work when the request is cancelled.

## Mid-stream envelope echo

The prefix sniffer only watches the opening bytes of a turn. An external model that writes real
prose first and then pastes a replayed `[Tool Result]` envelope defeats it, so that text reaches
the client and is stored as assistant output. `CursorMidstreamEchoObserver` records those
findings without throwing or withholding output, and at turn end eligible non-isolated turns
remint the conversation id for the NEXT turn. The current send is never retried: the echo is
already delivered and a resend would be an uncertain replay.

That rotation has its own bounded allowance in `src/adapters/cursor/thread-continuity.ts`,
separate from the incomplete-tool budget and from the overflow budget. It is bounded because a
model that echoes every turn would otherwise rotate the conversation forever, and it is separate
because echoing is cheap and repeatable while an incomplete client-tool stream is rare and
structural — one shared counter would let the cheap failure spend the allowance the other
recovery depends on. Exhaustion records a `midstream-envelope-echo-remint-exhausted` diagnostic
and keeps the conversation; a turn that completes without an echo clears only this counter. When
an incomplete-tool remint already fired in the same turn, the echo arm does not rotate again.

Assistant root replay drops echoed envelopes before they are sent back upstream
(`stripAssistantEchoedToolEnvelope`), so the transcript stops feeding itself. The strip starts at
a whole-line marker and ends at the next blank line rather than at the end of the message: the
envelope has no recognisable terminator and observed copies are not byte-exact, and truncating to
the end discarded a genuine answer whenever the model resumed after the echo. An envelope whose
pasted body contains its own blank line therefore leaves a remainder in replay; conversation
remint, not this filter, is the primary defence against a poisoned conversation.

`resolveCursorConversationId` prefers the retained thread override over a stored
`_cursorConversationId`. Only the remint path writes that store, so a stored id that disagrees
with it is the pre-remint value; preferring it let a second Responses chain in one Codex thread
keep resuming the conversation the previous turn had rotated away from. Isolated helper turns
still bypass both and mint their own id.

Translated audio/file admission follows the [final-adapter input contract](../adapters/registry.md#untranslated-input-media); native raw passthrough remains separate.
Canonical Responses identity sanitation and narrowly scoped pre-output combo recovery follow [request-local target compatibility](../runtime.md#request-local-target-compatibility); other adapter contracts remain unchanged.

Upstream API-key usage follows the [physical-attempt account attribution contract](../gui-and-management-api.md#upstream-key-account-attribution), independently of subscription quota observations.

Unicode pattern normalization uses [copy-on-write traversal](../transports/byte-accounting.md#unicode-pattern-normalization) while preserving the existing schema and wire semantics.

## Inbound stream-health clock ownership

The T04 inbound stream-health watchdog in `src/adapters/cursor/live-transport.ts` fails a turn that
received its first frame and then went silent for `CURSOR_STREAM_SILENCE_FAIL_MS` (30s) or
produced only liveness frames for `CURSOR_STREAM_HEARTBEAT_ONLY_FAIL_MS` (90s), instead of waiting
out the 300s bridge stall watchdog. One timer covers both thresholds and re-arms on every
decoded frame, so the deadline is always recomputed from the newest frame.

Those two budgets are the production contract and a test does not move them to make itself
pass. What a test may replace is the watchdog's time source: `streamHealthClock` on
`CursorTransportFactoryInput` supplies `now`, `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`, defaulting to the
globals, and the seam is deliberately scoped to T04 alone — the first-frame timer, the
turn-ended close grace, the client-tool finalize grace and the outbound heartbeat all stay on
the global timers, as does the `elapsedMs` diagnostic, whose `turnStartedAt` is stamped on the
wall clock.

The seam exists because the re-arming half of the contract cannot be stated against real
timers without also asserting that the machine keeps up: showing that a deadline did NOT expire
means keeping a synthetic server ahead of the silence budget for several multiples of it, which
is what failed in the unsharded macOS lane while the watchdog was correct. Scaling the budget
lengthens the window rather than shrinking the exposure. Every claim of that shape therefore lives
under the seam in `tests/providers/cursor/cursor-stream-health.test.ts`: that meaningful frames
re-arm both clocks, that liveness-only frames refresh the silence clock while the progress clock
still expires, and that the silence deadline is the one that fires when it is the earlier of the
two. That last one is load-bearing: a watchdog that dropped the `min()` and read only the progress
deadline would relax silence detection from 30s to 90s while every real-timer case stayed green,
because a later deadline still produces the same message. The firing half needs no seam and stays
on real timers in the same file: silence after the first frame, the progress budget alone failing a
turn when the silence budget is out of reach, and `turnEnded` cancelling the watchdog while the
server holds the stream open.
