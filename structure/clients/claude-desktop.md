# Claude Desktop Integration

Native result continuations and function-result injection follow [the mode-specific result and control contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#experimental-native-function-result-injection); this surface does not infer upstream support or alter its defaults.
Explicit Codex CLI installation observation does not launch or reconfigure a desktop client. See the [read-only observation contract](../runtime.md#explicit-codex-cli-installation-observation).

Native steering follows [the shared WebSocket contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#experimental-native-mid-turn-steering); this surface's defaults remain unchanged.

Desktop callers retain their existing ingress through the Responses
[core module ownership](../transports/responses.md#core-module-ownership). This surface retains its existing behavior.

The configuration-only [plaintext V2 contract](../subagents.md#plaintext-v2-agent-messages)
is scoped to canonical ChatGPT Responses forwarding; other source-area behavior described here is unchanged.

Codex-native model discovery follows the [shared retirement policy](../catalog.md#shared-catalog).
That projection does not migrate existing user-selected Desktop configuration or usage history.

Shared parsing and streaming follow the [request-copy](../transports/byte-accounting.md#request-copy-accounting) and [stream-buffer accounting](../transports/byte-accounting.md#stream-buffer-accounting) contracts. Response-attached WebSocket telemetry follows the [stage record identity contract](../transports/responses.md#passthrough-sse-stream-shapes-314).
Translated Anthropic first-frame usage follows the [runtime snapshot contract](../runtime.md#anthropic-streaming-usage-snapshots); Desktop profile state and usage-ledger ownership are unchanged.

Claude-only connections keep their existing non-failing readiness policy; displayed catalog reasons follow the [terminal rendering contract](../runtime.md#cli-readiness-diagnostics) whether they surface at connect time or on a later refresh.

The hub-side CLI dashboard uses the [management ingress address](../runtime.md#hub-management-dashboard-address); this does not change connected Desktop profile endpoints.

Native main reauthentication follows the [CLI JSON output contract](../runtime.md#native-main-reauth-json-output).

The Codex restart command follows the [CLI restart scope contract](../runtime.md#cli-codex-restart-scope).

Native OpenAI pool routing also accepts
[Orca-linked accounts](../codex-home.md#orca-source-owned-account-import), whose source resolution
belongs to the shared account store. The import CLI adds pool rows independently of Desktop profiles.

## Connected Claude Desktop profiles

The connection's local Codex readiness check follows the [selected-runtime probe contract](../runtime.md#remote-hub-hardening-ownership); general status hands its resolved command to this check instead of probing the version twice.
It does not discover lower-priority alternatives after a valid selection or alter Desktop ownership.

Connected `ocx claude desktop apply` reads the hub's Desktop snapshot and writes the hub origin
and exact hub-issued IDs to the local Desktop configuration. Static/hybrid embed the entries;
discovery-only keeps discovery on the hub. The hub owns family assignments and defaults; local
show/edit/import/export operations do not manage that profile. After hub changes or historical
client-only aliases, apply again and reselect the model. Connected `import --apply` is explicitly
unsupported and refuses before saving the import.

`src/claude/desktop-discovery-inputs.ts` owns the shared Desktop discovery projection used by
startup registry initialization and server discovery. `src/server/index.ts` exposes the explicit
`GET /v1/models?ids=desktop&format=desktop-config` snapshot, shaped as `{version:1,models:[...]}`
and sent with `Cache-Control: no-store`. `src/client/hub-client.ts` downloads it with the existing
data credential; `src/cli/claude-desktop.ts` selects connected apply, and `src/claude/desktop-3p.ts`
writes the resulting local Desktop configuration. No admin token, hub-profile upload or local
alias regeneration is part of this flow. Unsupported old hubs, invalid snapshots and unavailable
Desktop models fail apply without a local-catalog or loopback fallback.

Managed-namespace date aliases occupy `claude-opus-4-8-YYYYMMDD` slots across 2026-2035, not 2026
alone. The original 2026-only design held 365 slots and failed with "all 365 encoded date slots are
occupied" once a catalog exceeded 365 routes, because stale assignments are retained by design and
the set only grows. 2026 is still allocated first, so existing assignments keep their ids, and
2027-2035 are reached only after it fills. Years before 2026 stay rejected: dated ids such as
`claude-opus-4-8-20250201` are real Anthropic snapshot ids and the inbound decoder relies on that
distinction. Every emitted suffix stays eight digits so `modelMap` date-stripping keeps working.
`src/claude/desktop-profile.ts` owns this range.

Date-shaped Desktop IDs can overlap genuine native model IDs. When available discovery and
mapping evidence cannot resolve one, Messages and count-tokens return HTTP 503 with the fixed
`desktop_model_mapping_unavailable` error rather than classifying it as invalid. Unknown legacy hash aliases
remain HTTP 400; neither case reaches date-stripping or fallback routing. Known/registered IDs,
exact operator mappings and recognized native IDs keep their existing handling. Discovery refresh
or reapplying the connected hub profile may supply the missing mapping; retry alone does not
guarantee resolution.

The remote-alias slice does not change thinking/redacted-thinking replay or prompt-cache
behavior. Those remain the separate request tracked in #3719; proxy admission alone does not
establish native Anthropic passthrough or imply that translated Anthropic caching is disabled.

### Desktop ownership across the connection lifecycle

`src/claude/desktop-remote-store.ts` owns the first protected restoration baseline and the
connection-owned Desktop fields. `src/cli/claude-desktop.ts` handles connected apply, while
`src/client/connect.ts` coordinates key rotation/recovery and disconnect. Reapply and rotation retain the original
baseline. Restoration merges into current user fields, preserves unrelated profiles, and restores
the previous selection only while the managed profile is still selected. A later valid user
selection is not changed. A newly created profile with user additions is retained in readable
standard mode instead of deleting those additions.

A proven legacy current-hub/recognized-key profile without an original baseline can be adopted
by apply, rotation/recovery or direct disconnect without a new flag or prerequisite reapply.
Its explicit standard-fallback outcome is distinct from original restoration: only owned gateway
settings are removed, with user fields and independent valid selection preserved. Unknown keys,
changed managed fields or damaged restoration records remain conflicts, not permission to capture
new originals or overwrite user data.

Rotation changes credentials without changing model IDs, family/default choices or selecting the
managed profile again. The CLI reports `rotation: "committed"` only for the new active generation;
`rotation: "rolled_back"` means the previous generation was retained/restored and must not claim
revocation of that previous key. Incomplete recovery keeps the operation unresolved. Disconnect
restores Desktop even with `--keep-catalog`; retries preserve the original catalog choice and must
not clear a newer connection. Authorized uninstall completes or resumes owned Desktop cleanup
before removing OpenCodex state, and preserves recovery state when cleanup conflicts or fails.

These guarantees concern files on disk. Fully quitting and reopening Desktop is required after
apply, rotation/recovery or restoration; there is no automatic process restart or guarantee that
a running app discarded a key. Local disconnect does not revoke the hub key or remove arbitrary
external copies. Model-list snapshot version 1 remains a read-only contract, not a new lifecycle
or profile-upload API. Thinking replay and prompt caching remain separate in #3719.

The shared Responses path follows the [bounded multipart recovery contract](../subagents.md#multipart-encrypted-task-recovery); credential admission and retry policy remain unchanged.

Connected `ocx status` diagnostics follow the shared
[status credential binding](../runtime.md#remote-hub-status-credential-binding).

The smaller `_remoteHub` annotation from `src/cli/config-command.ts` is intentionally independent
of Desktop recovery and catalog readiness. It observes only the validated client record and local
data-token ownership, so displaying configuration cannot enter Desktop or client lifecycle work.

## Claude Desktop config-library resolution

The Desktop profile writer and the management status probe share
`resolveDesktop3pConfigLibraryPath`. The resolver reproduces Desktop's own rule rather than a guess:
an explicit `CLAUDE_USER_DATA_DIR` (or the opencodex override) wins; on Windows
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude-3p` wins; otherwise the Electron user-data path gains a `-3p` suffix if it
does not already have one. `configLibrary` is appended to that root.

`Claude-3p` is Desktop's real directory name, assembled at runtime from `"Claude" + "-3p"`, which is
why searching the app bundle for the literal string finds nothing. It is not a legacy path to migrate
away from. Resolution stays a pure function of (env, platform, home) so the Windows branch is
testable on any host: stubbing `process.platform` does not propagate to `os.platform()` under Bun.

Usage consumers preserve positive incomplete-history metadata as specified in [usage accounting](../gui-and-management-api.md#usage-accounting); readable totals are not represented as a complete ledger. Upstream API-key usage follows the [physical-attempt account attribution contract](../gui-and-management-api.md#upstream-key-account-attribution), independently of subscription quota observations.

Connected CLI usage follows the [client-scoped hub usage contract](../gui-and-management-api.md#usage-accounting); local management and account data remain separate.

Client usage transport follows [the runtime contract](../runtime.md#lifecycle), independently of Desktop inference.

The unregistered executor CLI module stores Remote Workspace state separately from client configuration; see [Remote Workspace](../remote-workspace.md).

Remote Workspace uses a separate, explicitly enabled server surface with structural WebSocket callbacks and awaited per-server cleanup; [its contract](../remote-workspace.md) owns that integration.

Listener startup diagnostics follow [the runtime lifecycle contract](../runtime.md#lifecycle); malformed optional listener blocks follow [config loading](../config.md#config-surface).
Chat helper admission in `src/server/responses/core.ts` follows the
[deferred stored-main contract](../providers/openai-tiers.md): only a needed Direct OpenAI helper
claims stored main, after terminal vision, routed vision and search exclusions.

Desktop requests routed to the Codex pool use the shared [automatic plan exclusion contract](../providers/openai-tiers.md#automatic-pool-plan-exclusions); explicit account-qualified targets retain their selection semantics.

The management quota DTO keeps Combo editing aligned with scoped inference evidence;
see [Combo editor routing quota](../gui-and-management-api.md#combo-editor-routing-quota).

Codex pool settings and their consumers follow the [reset-first ordering contract](../providers/openai-tiers.md#reset-first-account-ordering), including independent-quota fallback, preserved affinity, strategy-specific threshold summaries, and shared short-observation freshness for switch warnings.

Optional Codex transport-hint suppression is scoped to canonical Responses client output;
its defaults and exclusions are owned by [Responses transport](../transports/responses.md).

Provider summary defaults are Responses-specific and do not rewrite connected Claude Desktop profiles. See [inbound compatibility](../data-planes/inbound-compat.md).

Claude replay carries [Go conversation affinity](../data-planes/inbound-compat.md#claude-affinity-at-final-go-dispatch)
privately to final dispatch; preliminary route selection does not inject Go-only headers.

The explicit sync coordinator also accepts Cline CLI as a separate file integration. Its [paired-file recovery](integrations.md#cline-paired-files) is owned by the generic integration journal, independently of Desktop profile snapshots.

`claudeCode.stabilizePromptCache` is a default-off operator setting for
[translated instruction stabilization](../data-planes/inbound-compat.md#opt-in-claude-instruction-stabilization).
Config JSON preserves the boolean; only literal true activates the role-changing transform.
The lightweight top-level CLI help counts Cline CLI among the fifteen registered export clients; registry parity remains covered by the client help and integration tests.

Native Chat applies qualifying effort ceilings independently of model pins; pin selection precedes the cap and only pins or cap rewrites enter wire mapping. The [catalog effort contract](../catalog.md#ultra-reasoning-level) records the V1/compaction exemptions and caller-preservation boundary.

Pool quota producers and account commands follow the [bounded raw-observation contract](../providers/openai-tiers.md#bounded-pool-quota-observations), separate from the latest display snapshot and capacity estimates.

The account history response can include a [low-confidence effective capacity estimate](../providers/openai-tiers.md#observed-effective-token-capacity); usage normalization retains local-answer provenance so local responses cannot supply samples.

Account quota surfaces use [safe probe diagnostics](../transports/inventory.md#account-quota-failure-diagnostics) separately from quota validity, credential health and routing authority.

Combo child requests normalize effort and thinking controls against the selected target while retaining reasoning summaries; strict unknown targets preserve caller controls. The [Responses transport owner](../transports/responses.md) documents this boundary, and native Chat removes effort only for an explicit empty declaration or no-reasoning model.

Live sideband admission and its bounded upstream handshake follow the [runtime contract](../runtime.md#live-sideband-handshake); the ordinary Responses WebSocket exchange remains separate.

OpenCode is a separate launcher: its management catalog read retains local admin authority in the parent, while generated provider blocks reference only the child admission environment. It does not change Desktop configuration ownership.

The [explicit model-capability contract](../config.md#explicit-per-model-capability-declarations) preserves operator declarations through provider storage and catalog capture; it does not infer upstream capability or change this surface's routing behavior.

Exact [model input declarations](../config.md#explicit-per-model-capability-declarations) now feed text-only eligibility and catalog hints; existing image-description/omission handling consumes them before the main upstream send.

Provider-scoped approval reviewer settings are projected by the [catalog owner](../catalog.md#provider-scoped-approval-reviewer); this surface retains its existing routing, transport and account-selection behavior.

Shared response-log retention and native SSE inspection pacing follow the [bounded inspection contract](../transports/byte-accounting.md#response-log-inspection); other subsystem behavior remains unchanged.

Native steering retains fixed phase deadlines and reconciled replay output; see the [steering stability contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#steering-deadlines-and-replay-completeness).

Native steering generation overrides, explicit public-API eligibility and the consent-gated wire probe follow the [shared control contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#steering-settings-public-api-and-diagnostic-probe); this owner does not change routing or execute diagnostic tools.

Dashboard Fast-row persistence and client refresh follow the [Fast selector rows setting contract](../gui-and-management-api.md#fast-selector-rows-setting).

The [compaction routing override](../transports/responses.md#compaction-routing-overrides) is scoped to Codex Responses metadata and original Responses ingress; Claude Messages replay retains its own routing.
