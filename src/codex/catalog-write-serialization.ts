/**
 * K — the permanent catalog serialization primitive.
 *
 * Round 4 of the audit killed the idea that "the replacement happens under a
 * lock" is enough. The retained `/api/sync` chain reads the active catalog,
 * captures it, awaits provider gathering, and only then writes from that
 * captured state (`src/codex/catalog/sync.ts:513,520,526,565`). If convergence
 * publishes Y while that await is pending, taking a lock afterwards does not
 * make the captured X fresh — the writer legally overwrites Y while holding it.
 * So K serializes the whole read-transform-write transaction, either by
 * recomputing under K or by revalidating complete evidence under K, not by
 * guarding the last rename.
 *
 * The second defect that round found was subtler: an opaque TypeScript permit
 * type proves a permit-bearing call path EXISTS. It cannot prove the callback
 * still holds K. A leaked permit used after its callback returned type-checks
 * perfectly. So the type is not the mechanism — this module owns a private
 * active-permit registry, and every mutator asks it at runtime whether the
 * permit it holds is still live for the home it is about to write.
 *
 * K is permanent and is NOT WP11's native write lock. It never reads or
 * advances the native pair. Order is `N -> K -> C`; there is no `C -> K` and no
 * `K -> N` (`005_contract.md:660-762`).
 *
 * Design record: devlog/_fin/260804_codex_write_substrate/005_contract.md §3.
