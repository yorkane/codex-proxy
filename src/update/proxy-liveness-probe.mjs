/**
 * Is something still answering `/healthz` as an opencodex proxy on this endpoint?
 *
 * Absent PID and runtime-port files are weak evidence that the proxy is gone: a crashed
 * but still-listening process, or one supervised outside our records, leaves no files and
 * keeps the port. Replacing package files under it leaves a server running a mix of old
 * and new modules, which is the hazard `ocx update` stops the proxy to avoid (#3008).
 *
 * Synchronous and dependency-free because it runs inside the plain-Node launcher's
 * `runNpmSelfUpdate`, which is not async and cannot import the TypeScript liveness module.
 * A separate Node child does the fetch so the caller keeps its straight-line control flow.
 *
 * Returns `"live" | "dead" | "unknown"`, and the caller treats `unknown` as a reason to
 * stop. Fail-open was wrong here: a listener that accepts connections but withholds
 * `/healthz`, or a probe that times out, is exactly the state where replacing package
 * files is most dangerous, and "we could not tell" is not evidence the proxy is gone.
 * A refused connection or a definitive non-OpenCodex answer earns `"dead"`. So does one
 * more observation when the dial is neither answered nor refused (a timeout, or a dropped
 * SYN as with a listener bound to a tailnet address): the child tries one transient
 * exclusive bind of the same host and port, and a successful bind means nothing holds the
 * port at that instant. The fallback runs only for a literal IP address, because a name can
 * resolve to different addresses for the dial and the bind. A failed bind (`EADDRINUSE`,
 * `EADDRNOTAVAIL`, any error) stays
 * `"unknown"`, a held-but-silent port included. The whole probe is bounded by the child's
 * own `timeoutMs` plus a 1500 ms spawn ceiling, after which it is `"unknown"`. A successful
 * bind is a statement about that moment, not a promise that the endpoint cannot restart.
