/**
 * Codex V2 conversation lineage: root, parent, child, grandchild (#4546, wp8).
 *
 * The pool affinity key used to prefer `x-codex-parent-thread-id`, which collapsed two different
 * identities into one map. A root bound under `app:HMAC(session, thread)` while every child bound
 * under the RAW parent id, so siblings shared one binding entry unrelated to the root's, and a
 * grandchild keyed on its own parent landed on a key nobody had ever bound. The proxy therefore
 * treated one workflow as unrelated strangers even while the provider saw a single prompt-cache
 * family.
 *
 * This module records the real relation -- each thread's own conversation key, its immediate
 * parent's thread id, and the transitive root -- scoped per authenticated caller, bounded, and
 * process-local like the binding map it feeds.
 *
 * What it is for, and what it is not for:
 *
 * - FIRST PLACEMENT. Largely subsumed by cohort keying (#4780): a member of a tree that any
 *   other member has already bound resolves to that same binding, so there is nothing to place.
 *   `pickLineageServingAccount` in ./routing remains for the one case cohort keying cannot
 *   unify -- a session-less chain whose parent is not recorded in this scope -- and is gated on
 *   the parent's key actually differing from this request's.
 * - COST ATTRIBUTION. {@link codexThreadLineageLookup} and {@link codexLineageRootForRequest}
 *   answer which root workflow a conversation belongs to, so a grandchild's spend aggregates
 *   onto the root. No budget is implemented here.
 * - WORKER CLASSIFICATION, exposed but not rewired. Admission classifies header-only today: a
 *   request naming a parent plus a distinct `thread-id` is worker traffic, and a request without
 *   `thread-id` is interactive even when it belongs to a recorded fan-out.
 *   {@link codexLineageWorkflowLane} is the lineage-backed answer a later lane consumes.
 *
 * Scope is an HMAC of the caller's Authorization header under a process-local key, the same
 * posture as the affinity key itself. Two callers presenting identical thread ids can never read
 * each other's lineage, and no raw identifier or durable hash is stored.
 *
 * LIFETIME, stated plainly because the word "affinity" invites the opposite assumption: none of
 * this survives the process. The binding map is in memory, and the HMAC key above is fresh random
 * bytes taken at module load, so a restart does not merely forget the table -- it makes yesterday's
 * keys unreproducible. This is a warm-start hint for the life of one proxy process, never durable
 * account ownership, and nothing here should be read as a promise to a conversation that outlives
 * a restart.
 *
 * The one upgrade that is neither a fresh start nor an untouched process is a code swap under a
 * live conversation, where the binding map is still populated with entries made under the
 * pre-#4546 RAW parent key. Silently rebinding those cold is the exact defect this module exists
 * to prevent, so a request that names a parent carries {@link CodexThreadLineage.legacyConversationKey}
 * -- the key the old rule would have returned -- and routing adopts that binding once under the new
 * key and retires the legacy entry. It is a one-way migration, not a second lookup path.

 * #4780: a bare `thread-id` with neither a session nor a parent stays unbound, exactly as the
 * Desktop fallback required both halves of its pair. Only the VALUE moves.
 *
 * Every member of one tree resolves to the SAME key, because the cohort is the binding unit
 * (#4780):
 *
 * - root (`session-id` + `thread-id`) -> the session's cohort key;
 * - child and grandchild (parent + own `thread-id`) -> the same cohort key, since they carry the
 *   same session;
 * - parent-only (no `thread-id`) -> the same cohort key, derived from the session or, without
 *   one, read from the parent's record.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT A REVERT OF #4546 wp8, and reading it as one would flip it straight back. wp8
 * fixed a real incoherence: a child keyed under the RAW parent id, which is a different identity
 * from the root's own `app:HMAC(session, thread)` binding, so siblings shared an entry unrelated
 * to the root's and a grandchild keying on its own parent landed on a key nobody had ever bound.
 * A cohort key cannot produce that, because the root's own binding IS the cohort key: there is
 * one identity for the tree rather than two competing ones. What wp8 additionally gave each
 * thread -- a binding of its own -- is what #4780 deliberately gives up, and the reason is that
 * upstream never agreed to it: `prompt_cache_key` is keyed on the session the whole tree shares,
 * so a proxy that splits the tree makes every split member assert a warm prefix that is cold on
 * its account.
 *
 * The parent-only case keeps the trap it always had. Such a turn belongs to the parent's
 * conversation, so it must land on the binding the parent is already using. With a session in
 * hand that is immediate, since both derive the same cohort key. Without one, the recorded key
 * wins and the parent id anchors the fallback; the raw parent id is never the answer.
