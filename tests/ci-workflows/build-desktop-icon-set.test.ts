/**
 * The committed desktop icons are generated from one SVG by `desktop/scripts/generate-icons.ts`.
 * That script's own `--check` compares byte for byte, which is the strongest statement available
 * — and it is not available here: it needs `rsvg-convert` and `iconutil`, and the renderer is not
 * pinned, so two machines with different librsvg builds disagree on bytes without anything being
 * wrong. Asserting byte identity in CI would mean asserting the runner's renderer version.
 *
 * What CI can assert on any platform with no renderer at all is that the committed set still has
 * the shape the generator declares: every size present, every raster actually that size, both
 * containers carrying exactly the members the script packs, and nothing hand-added alongside.
 * Every expectation below is read out of the generator, so adding a size there and forgetting to
 * regenerate fails here rather than being restated in two places that can drift apart.
