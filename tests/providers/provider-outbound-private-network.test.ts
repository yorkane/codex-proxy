 * #758: a stock Ollama provider passed config validation -- which consults the registry's
 * `allowPrivateNetworkByDefault` -- and was then refused at the outbound fetch, which read only
 * the operator's `allowPrivateNetwork` flag. Two boundaries disagreeing about one provider.
 *
 * These drive the PINNED transport path (no `provider.fetch`), because that is where discovery
 * actually runs and where the permission was being dropped. `resolveAddresses` is injected so the
 * decision is observable without a network: the value it receives IS the fix.
