/**
 * N — one bounded writer per canonical `CODEX_HOME`.
 *
 * The failure this closes is lock SPLITTING plus event-loop denial, not a
 * missing mutex. Two spellings of one Codex home can reach different textual
 * paths, and a lock held across provider discovery or history walking recreates
 * the 10.5-second listener stall that killed the previous design.
 *
 * Three decisions are load-bearing and each was forced by a defect:
 *
 * - The namespace keys on the EFFECTIVE USER (uid/SID), never on a home path.
 *   Under Bun 1.3.14 both `os.homedir()` and `os.userInfo().homedir` follow the
 *   environment, so a service and a CLI for one account can see different homes
 *   and coordinate through different databases — exclusion defeated, silently.
 *   `resolveCodexCoordinatorDatabasePath` owns that; this module consumes its
 *   result verbatim and appends nothing.
 *
 * - The commit callback is SYNCHRONOUS. Provider I/O, subprocesses, history
 *   walking and retry sleeps are forbidden beneath it; a thenable that slips
 *   through the type is detected, rolled back, and rejected.
 *
 * - Acquisition is finite and typed. `busy` means try again; `refused` means
 *   never. Collapsing them is how a permanent denial becomes an endless retry
 *   loop wearing the costume of contention.
 *
 * Lock order is `N -> C`. C is `withConfigMutationLockSync`, entered while N is
 * held and released before N commits. There is no `C -> N`.
 *
 * Design record: devlog/_fin/260804_codex_write_substrate/030_lock_protocol.md.
