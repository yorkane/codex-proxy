# Kiro Provider

Kiro retry permits retain their [physical executor span](../transports/responses-spend.md#historical-pool-continuity-and-rollback) through credential selection and rebuild. A newly selected identity needs its own normal-capacity seed before inference I/O; a refused permit leaves the executor untouched.

Native steering follows [the shared WebSocket contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#experimental-native-mid-turn-steering); this surface's defaults remain unchanged.

The configuration-only [plaintext V2 contract](../subagents.md#plaintext-v2-agent-messages)
is scoped to canonical ChatGPT Responses forwarding; other source-area behavior described here is unchanged.

The shared hosted-tool policy has no Codex Spark-specific branch. Kiro continues to use its
provider capabilities below; see [Responses compatibility](../transports/responses.md#responses-httpsse).

## Kiro CLI executable resolution

Native device login is an add-only Kiro account path for Builder ID, Google, and GitHub.
It uses fixed Kiro authorization hosts, guarded outbound POSTs, and a bounded process-local
flow table. A flow ID is returned only at start; status and cancellation require that ID and
the same management principal kind. Polling follows the server's interval, and only an exact
approval shape reaches the protected OAuth store. Device codes and tokens never enter
management responses. Native slots carry `loginOrigin: "kiro-device"`; kiro-cli reauth
refuses them before starting CLI work. Upstream verification URLs require HTTPS, no credentials
or control characters, and a 2048-character limit; user codes use 4–32 plain alphanumeric or
hyphen characters. Completed flow results are consumed once, terminal entries expire after
60 seconds, and the table holds at most 16 entries. Terminal entries retain no config snapshot.
Explicit reauth rotates login identity, while token
refresh preserves it. A first-account config-publication failure compensates the new slot
through the existing receipt ownership check.

Forced and add-account login spawn the local CLI, so `resolveKiroCliExecutable` in
`src/oauth/kiro-credentials.ts` decides which file runs with credential-flow arguments. The
canonical `kiro-cli` name is tried on `PATH` and then in the platform install locations. Only
after every canonical candidate misses, and only on Windows, does the short `kiro.exe` name count,
and only inside the two dedicated `Kiro-Cli` folders (`%LOCALAPPDATA%` and `Program Files`) when
their base is a fully qualified drive path. A short name is never resolved from `PATH` or from the
shared POSIX bin directories (`~/.local/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`), where an
unrelated `kiro` such as the Kiro IDE launcher can live. Coverage:
`tests/providers/kiro/kiro-windows-cli-executable-path.test.ts`.

## Forced-login credential rollback

A forced login uses a receipt-bearing auth-store write naming its exact account, credential
generation, selection revision, and prior slot. If later provider publication fails, rollback is
one serialized compare-and-swap mutation: it removes or restores only that still-owned generation.
A concurrent account addition, selection, or credential refresh wins and is never inferred from a
before/after account-ID set.

> Decision record: [ADR-0109](../decisions/ADR-0109-kiro-login-rollback-ownership.md)

Kiro usage probing uses the same request-profile resolver as generation. A non-OIDC
account without a formable ARN is not probed. Persisted quota and exhaustion evidence
are bound independently by observation time, reset, and login identity, never by token
or raw account label; removal, identity change, expiry, or malformed disk degrades routing
evidence to unknown. Initial routing reads it through `kiroAccountEvidence`.
The same identity-fenced reading carries precise plan `kiroCreditsUsed` and
`kiroCreditsLimit`; missing or expired evidence has no metric sample. The automatic
candidate filter and account list both use `kiroAutoSelection` from
`src/oauth/generic-account-failover.ts`. Its closed reasons are `needs_reauth`,
`suspended`, `cooldown`, and `quota_exhausted`. An active singleton can still send
when it is excluded as an alternative. The existing `health` field does not reflect
Kiro suspension or quota exhaustion, so `health: ok` can coexist with
`autoSelectable: false`; the GUI does not display the new projection.

After an account is admitted, a detached `ListAvailableModels` request reads that account's
regional management host with its own timeout and account-paired bearer/profile. The request
never waits for discovery. `OPENCODEX_KIRO_MODEL_DISCOVERY=0` disables this optional path at
call time, primarily for tests or operational rollback. The process-local list is fenced to
the login identity, refreshed after one hour, and retained as last good for at most 24 hours.
Malformed or empty replies preserve the static model roster. Observed model membership only
prefers accounts already eligible and with room under a configured cap; unknown IDs remain
callable. Reported `tokenLimits.maxInputTokens` informs a conservative catalog and token
estimate window, including the static limit when any live account lacks evidence. Only accounts
that have served acquire list evidence; inactive siblings may remain unknown until refusal
rotation reaches them. The public catalog advertises only observed IDs made of plain
characters (no `/` the router would have to decode), at most 64 across the roster; every
observed ID still informs routing preference.

`src/adapters/kiro-refusal.ts` recognizes an exact monthly reason on HTTP 400/429 and a
confirmed suspension on HTTP 403; ordinary 400/403 remains an error without an account
verdict. `src/providers/kiro-usage.ts` records monthly exhaustion only for the sent
credential generation and login identity, independently of quota observation time. A
completed response from that same live credential clears an older verdict after disk
hydration. Suspension is a process-local quarantine; rate refusals use a short cooldown.
Reactive account rotation is presence-driven even when a proactive preference switch is
off. Pre-dispatch exclusion of an already refused account requires effective proactive
preference with the provider override taking precedence over the global setting.
Kiro OAuth may use `least-loaded` as an opt-in proactive strategy under `pool.kernel`.
`maxConcurrentPerAccount` independently limits active requests on each account in this
process: a full selected account waits up to 250 ms, then returns 503
`account_capacity` with `Retry-After: 1`. Capacity does not select a sibling;
reactive refusal rotation remains presence-driven and prefers a sibling with room.
A released slot is handed to the first live waiter before it wakes, so a new arrival
cannot take it, and every send (first send, reactive rotation, 401 replay) holds the lease of
the account whose credentials it carries: a replay that resolves a different account takes
that account's lease first or stops with the formatted 401.

## Kiro client parallel-tool hint

Kiro's wire remains serialized even when an OpenAI Responses client sends
`parallel_tool_calls: true`. That request field is permissive: it allows parallel calls but does not
require the routed transport to expose a matching flag. The Kiro catalog therefore continues to
advertise `supports_parallel_tool_calls: false`, and the adapter emits no parallel-control field,
while accepting the client hint and translating the ordinary tool catalog normally.

> Decision record: [ADR-0060](../decisions/ADR-0060-kiro-client-parallel-tool-hint.md)

Kiro's own `kiroToolName` rewrite in `src/adapters/kiro-wire.ts` is CodeWhisperer-only and
reserves the private completion tool. Meta Muse 64-character MCP aliases live in
`src/responses/muse-tool-name-alias.ts` and must not import that Kiro helper.

## Kiro Responses text controls

Kiro shares the Responses freeform restoration boundary in
`src/responses/apply-patch-envelope.ts`: contractual `input` wrappers are unwrapped, while alternate
field and outer-fence recovery is limited to unambiguous bare or `default.`-prefixed `exec` and `apply_patch` bodies.

Kiro refuses structured output and tolerates every other Responses `text` member. `text.format`
of type `json_schema` or `json_object` is a contract the CodeWhisperer wire cannot honour, so the
adapter rejects it rather than returning prose to a caller expecting JSON. `text.verbosity` and
`text.format: {"type":"text"}` are preferences, not contracts; they are accepted and dropped,
because `buildKiroPayload` composes `conversationState` from parsed fields and never forwards the
raw body.

> Decision record: [ADR-0061](../decisions/ADR-0061-kiro-responses-text-controls.md)

## Bounded fallback HTTP errors

Tool-enabled turns in `src/adapters/kiro/stream.ts` hold ordinary text through the one
bounded completion retry. A valid private final answer or accepted retry text supersedes
first-attempt prose, so the client receives one final answer. A real tool call releases
held progress as commentary before the tool; failed validation also releases progress
and preserves the non-retryable boundary. Held events stay charged to the translator
budget until emitted, discarded, or cancelled; replay collectors are released after
retry construction. Native `END_TURN` and `STOP_SEQUENCE` alone do not distinguish
progress from an answer and therefore still require validation. Normal private completion
and real tool calls need no completion retry.
Coverage: `tests/providers/kiro/kiro-single-final.test.ts` and
`tests/server/server-kiro-completion-e2e.test.ts`.

`src/adapters/kiro-retry.ts` uses the configured executor for every generation send and may try the existing `q.{region}.amazonaws.com` host once after a canonical-host HTTP 502/503/504 before output, subject to the same send budget. Reset, 429, alternate, and completion-fallback sends wait for a pacing slot; only the first send is pre-paid. Kiro web-search turns are paced as well. A Kiro-local wrapper maps its header deadline to HTTP 504 without changing shared or Google fetch behavior; caller cancellation remains an abort. Final HTTP 5xx text is fixed for clients, and opt-in provider diagnostics carry only closed-set status and classification codes.

When a first Kiro stream needs a completion fallback, the fallback response's non-success
body is read through the shared display-safe bounded reader with the attempt's abort signal.
The adapter emits an error with the upstream status and does not emit a successful completion.
A body that exceeds the reader's limit is cancelled and cannot contribute unbounded text to
the error message. Coverage: `tests/providers/kiro/kiro-fallback-error-body.test.ts`.

## Kiro reasoning round-trip (`signature`)

Kiro never returns plaintext reasoning for its **GPT-5.6 family** (`gpt-5.6-sol`, `-terra`,
`-luna`): `reasoningContentEvent` carries a KMS-encrypted blob rather than readable reasoning. It
arrives on `signature`, holding the `.KTR~~…` value verbatim, which is what every capture of those
models sent. The event's `text` field is not absent — every captured GPT-5.6 frame left a literal
`"..."` placeholder there, which the adapter forwards as a `reasoning_raw_delta` — but it never
carries model reasoning, so `signature` is the only field worth replaying
(`tests/providers/kiro/kiro-reasoning-roundtrip.test.ts`).
Their `additionalModelRequestFieldsSchema` (`ListAvailableModels`) accepts only
`reasoning.effort` with `additionalProperties: false` — there is no display/summary opt-in, so this
is the only reasoning these models can return, and all three select that native field
(`KIRO_NATIVE_EFFORT_FIELDS` in `src/adapters/kiro/reasoning.ts`). Kiro's own CLI replays the blob
on the matching `assistantResponseMessage.reasoningContent` to preserve model reasoning across
turns; dropping it makes every turn restart without the previous turn's reasoning. Verified on
kiro-cli 2.14.1 and 2.16.0, all three models.

Native effort admission is narrower than model eligibility: luna and terra send only
`low`, `medium`, `high`, and `max` on the native field. Their `xhigh` requests retain the
previous emulated thinking tags because that native rung is unverified. A future shared
effort rung does not expand this allowlist. Sol and Opus keep their existing native ladder.

The two members of `reasoningContent` are not interchangeable. The wire validates the shape of the
member rather than its content, and the signature is not base64 — its alphabet contains `.` and
`~` — so a blob replayed as `redactedContent` is rejected with `REQUEST_BODY_INVALID`
("Improperly formed request"). `signature` therefore takes the verbatim value and
`redactedContent` remains the home for the base64 shape another model may send. Which field a blob
arrived on is carried by the blob itself, one opaque string with a `signature:` tag, rather than by
a second value that could drift from it; provider data cannot forge the tag, because base64 has no
colon.

The Claude 4.6+/5 entries advertise a different, richer contract (`thinking.type` adaptive/disabled,
`thinking.display` summarized/omitted, `output_config.effort`, `max_tokens`) and are not covered by
that measurement; older Claude, deepseek, minimax, glm, and qwen entries advertise no additional
fields at all. The handling below keys off the wire field, not the model id, so any model that
sends either member round-trips.

- The tagged blob rides the existing `ocxr1:` envelope as `krc`
  (`src/responses/reasoning-envelope.ts`) on an envelope-only reasoning item — `summary: []`, no
  text deltas — so it stays invisible in the Codex app while round-tripping, exactly like the
  hidden-thinking path.
- **Pairing is backwards.** Kiro emits `reasoningContentEvent` at the END of an assistant turn,
  after content AND tool calls. A `krc`-only item therefore belongs to the turn that already
  closed, so the parser attaches it to the PRECEDING assistant message rather than folding it into
  the following turn like ordinary reasoning (`src/responses/parser.ts`). With no assistant turn to
  own it, the blob is dropped rather than mis-paired.
- The blob lives on `OcxAssistantMessage.kiroRedactedReasoning`, not on a thinking content part, so
  no other adapter replays provider-private state if the conversation switches providers.

Kiro reports context pressure in its own `contextUsageEvent`, which is the authoritative source. On
every capture taken (2.14.1 and 2.16.0) `metadataEvent` carried only `stopReason` — which is why
reading the percentage from `metadataEvent` alone never saw a value — but the parser still accepts a
finite `contextUsagePercentage` (and a `tokenUsage` block) there as a fallback, so a value parsed
from `metadataEvent` is legitimate rather than impossible. Both feed the same field, and any
positive value overwrites an earlier one.

Spend arrives in `meteringEvent` as **credits, not tokens**. No captured response carried
`tokenUsage` on any event, which is why Kiro token usage stays estimated. The parser preserves
`meteringEvent` unit/usage (`amount` is an alias) and optional `unitPlural`; credit readings populate
`OcxUsage.providerCredits` independently of token metadata. The latest reading within a response
is a snapshot; separate completion-fallback responses add their credits. Missing metering stays
absent and measured zero stays zero. `initial-response` carries `conversationId` through the same
validated provider-state path as `messageMetadataEvent`. Unknown event types produce opt-in
`debugProviderDiagnostic` entries containing only the event-type length, never the raw header or payload.
The final usage row records summed request spend across billed physical sends; sealed attempt
rows preserve per-serving-account spend in `src/usage/log.ts`.
Coverage: `tests/providers/kiro/kiro-metering-events.test.ts`,
`tests/providers/kiro/kiro-metering-usage.test.ts`, and
`tests/server/server-kiro-completion-e2e.test.ts`.

## Image count limits

`src/adapters/kiro-images.ts` limits each user input message to 20 inline images and
the whole `GenerateAssistantResponse` request to 100. It applies the per-message
limit first, then removes the oldest structurally usable history images to meet
the request count before applying the separate 18 MiB image byte budget.
A bounded text marker remains in each affected message; the current turn's
newest images are retained.

## Remote image references

Kiro's wire inlines base64 bytes only, so a remote `https` image reference cannot be
sent. It used to be dropped with neither bytes nor any marker, so the payload and the
evidence that an attachment existed both disappeared.

`countKiroUninlinableImages` counts non-`data:` image references, and the payload
builder appends a bounded marker to that turn's text. The
marker is appended before `rawGroupText` is computed, because adjacency grouping
rebuilds a turn's content from its collected texts and would otherwise discard it.

No fetch is introduced: resolving the reference server-side would add an outbound
request on a request path. The marker carries a count and no URL, because a remote
image URL can carry a signed token.

Malformed `data:` image URLs that lack a comma or image bytes also cannot be
inlined. `kiroImageOmissionMarker` reports those separately from remote references,
without echoing the URL or its bytes. The payload builder carries that marker in
both user turns and tool results, including grouped adjacent tool outputs.

Translated audio/file admission follows the [final-adapter input contract](../adapters/registry.md#untranslated-input-media); native raw passthrough remains separate.
