// instructions.
//
// The GPT-5.6 entries are measured against the live runtime rather than inferred from the vendor
// schema: the field is accepted (HTTP 200) and the encrypted reasoning blob that comes back grows
// with the effort. On one fixed hard prompt — a primality search plus a 20-bit recurrence count —
// luna's blob measured 5,130 chars at `low`, 16,686 at `medium`, 30,670 at `high` and 48,594 at
// `max`, against 13,118 with no effort signal at all; terra's measured 34,590 and 38,106 at native
// `max` against 11,758 and 17,598 bare, two repetitions each. The channel this replaces — the
// emulated `<thinking_mode>` tag block, which was all those models used to receive — measured
// 21,202 (`low`) and 28,302 (`max`) for luna, i.e. between that model's native `medium` and
// `high`, never reaching native `max`. `gpt-5.6-sol`'s native `max` cross-checked at 30,498 on the
// same prompt. Terra's absence from this table was therefore an omission rather than a capability
// difference: what the earlier Sol-only scope recorded was not reproducible here.

 * The blob travels as ONE opaque string: adapter event, `ocxr1:` reasoning envelope, then
