/**
 * Profile for the official Claude Code CLI — Anthropic's own harness (§三十一).
 *
 * The CLI owns the account: OpenCodex stores no Claude token, reads none, and injects none, so a
 * subscription turn is spent through the harness Anthropic ships instead of a replayed Claude Code
 * identity against the Messages API. There is exactly one destination, so the profile carries the
 * single-binary shape of the shared coding-agent seam and no `tokenEnv`.
 *
 * Evidence (verified 2026-09-24 against the installed CLI 2.1.270): the full argument set built by
 * `./adapter.ts` is accepted — including `--tools ""`, `--setting-sources ""`, `--effort` and
 * `--system-prompt` — and a stream-json turn reaches the account check, ending on a terminal
 * `result` frame with `is_error: true` and "Not logged in · Please run /login" rather than on an
 * unknown option. The success-path frame shapes are the shared parser's, unchanged from the family
 * this profile joins (`../coding-agent/protocol.ts`).
