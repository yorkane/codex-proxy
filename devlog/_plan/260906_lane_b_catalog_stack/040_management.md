# 040 — Provider model deletion, visibility and static default-only sync

Class C3 with C4 review for model identity and management mutations. Active P baseline: `67fdf24eb6e661f4d9e84aaa86a4eb39c6f3ba58` (2026-09-06 KST), including the verified ordering/Lab landing `76356176c` and D Cursor description preservation. Source #3659 remains OPEN at `ff4e5cd5352b9c1bd05e3de0091f3483ca130be5`; all five original commits are by gqchen <276851182@qq.com>. This active contract supersedes conflicting proposals in the historical source appendix. The source patch authority is the actual merge base `6585e6a70f42be8b6c81ff20d4fa0f39f7da03db`; target snapshot `af50c6d3` is not a valid substitute. Current independent preparation found no need for a new endpoint, store, dependency or visual redesign.

The previous ordering cycle is complete. The new implementation stays in bound f80e on `codex/lane-b-04-management`. User authorization includes no-verify pushes, admin merges and immediate source closure after verified dev inclusion. No local tests, suites, typechecks or builds; execution is isolated remote or hosted CI. No release/deployment, global account or service changes.

## Accepted behavior

Delete removes one stored custom definition by stable ID. It sends exactly one DELETE and never an automatic visibility PUT. A native or discovered counterpart can return and keep the inventory count unchanged. Hide sends exactly one visibility PUT using a confirmed server row. Add saves a definition and preserves independent visibility/selection policy. No permanent browser tombstone survives a refresh. The existing Models page is the recovery surface for hidden rows, including when the provider tab is empty.

The frontend consumes existing /api/models DTOs once per parent refresh alongside the full /api/selected-models response. It does not add disabled to selected-models or introduce another identity classifier. Existing full available, selected and liveModelCounts retain their meanings. The only production backend change is the source static-default seed plus any narrowly demonstrated regression repair approved in this cycle.

## Planned interfaces and owners

- Reuse type-only ModelRow from gui/src/pages/models-shared.ts. Add a strict row-array boundary parser/grouping beside current provider-workspace helpers, with dedicated model-inventory module if size warrants. Validate nonblank provider/id/namespaced, boolean disabled and optional native/custom/pending flags, plus nonblank customId for custom rows. Invalid destructive identity fails the whole refresh. Preserve raw strings; use Map/null-prototype records and namespaced uniqueness.
- ProviderWorkspaceShell owns one paired read per refresh epoch. Adopt both successful responses together; do not claim cross-endpoint transactional consistency. Maintain a current refresh key/revision and the revision of the adopted snapshot. Invalidate readiness immediately on retry, external refresh or mutation reconciliation; deferred effect loading alone is insufficient. Keep cancellation/generation rejection and use existing bounded fetch conventions.
- Pass modelRows: ModelRow[] | null and refresh revision/readiness through DetailSlotData, Providers, ProviderDetails and keyed ProviderModels. null is unavailable; [] is a successful empty projection. Add onOpenModels from Providers using existing navigateHash("models").
- ProviderModels refreshes its full custom-definition GET whenever the parent revision changes, and records the successful ownership revision. Controls require a current row snapshot and current custom ownership, no load error, no pending mutation and matching customId/provider/modelId for Delete. Refetch both resources after success, failure or an ambiguous response. Successful ownership GET must not erase unresolved mutation feedback.
- On confirmed snapshots, render non-disabled DTOs; key chips, copy and busy state by namespaced. Identical raw labels with distinct selectors are disambiguated using namespaced. An unavailable snapshot may retain old/read-only fallback data; successful empty must not insert configured/default/native rows. Pending/unknown identity has no mutation action.
- Rail count uses the full unique non-disabled DTO inventory before query or render cap. Detail search/truncation count is separately understood. An allowlist badge does not change inventory count, and native selection does not borrow a routed same-raw-id badge. Full available/provenance stay separate.
- Delete custom records only; other confirmed rows Hide with row.provider, row.id and row.native === true. Block both handlers and all buttons on the shared busy/readiness condition. Do not infer native from provider name or substitute Hide when custom ownership is unavailable.
- Preserve existing Add duplicate/encoded-collision checks using full raw configured/discovered/custom inputs. Do not newly reject a valid native override solely because a native DTO has the same raw id. Existing hidden custom definitions remain duplicates and use Models to restore visibility. Validate POST 201 identity and stable ID before adoption. Saved, saved-but-hidden, refresh-pending and unconfirmed-save outcomes are distinct; no automatic POST retry or implicit unhide.

## Source carry disposition

Preserve gqchen <276851182@qq.com> in the carry commit and Co-authored-by trailer. Carry the static default-only patch, source UI controls/icons/locales and docs with adaptation. Omit the source selected-models disabled-map API hunk and its redundant parser/prop chain. Replace source Delete-then-Hide and raw-ID tombstones with the contract above. Preserve the complete historical source appendix as evidence, explicitly superseded where it conflicts with this amendment. Refresh the screenshot from the actual amended UI; the source image is historical.

## Verification required before completion

- GUI exact request counts for cancel/Delete/Hide; custom-only delete/re-add/remount; native and discovered replacement after Delete; raw/encoded and account-qualified collisions; invalid DTO/native/custom metadata; pending rows; failed custom GET; three-resource refresh readiness with reversed responses, external custom-ID replacement and provider switch; malformed/ambiguous POST reconciliation without repeat writes; independent hidden/allowlist state preserved; empty and 300+ inventories; recovery link visible in empty state; counts match the canonical pre-search inventory.
- Actual management DELETE→GET round trips, preserving native/routed/account hides and existing validation. No new management write semantics or relaxation.
- Static omitted/empty models + default + retain union/dedupe, explicit list precedence, no default/no lists, forward early return, successful-empty live discovery; no extra network activity in static cases.
- Independent C4 source/security review and final UI/code review. Actual isolated compiled GUI with synthetic API state, screenshots and remount/error evidence. Root/GUI focused checks, typecheck, docs build and exact-head hosted functional CI. No local suite/test/typecheck/build.
- Update English and translations for static seeding and the amended Delete/Hide meaning, and the existing source of truth. Do not document an unimplemented disabled-map API.

Obtain an independent full plan audit before B. One B implements this management slice only; Fable remains a separate later cycle. Preserve the original patch below as historical source evidence, not current implementation instructions.

## Concrete component contract and file inventory

The parent passes `modelRows: ModelRow[] | null`, `modelRevision: string` and `modelRowsReady: boolean` through its existing detail chain. `modelRevision` represents the current API base, external refresh token and local retry epoch. The adopted parent snapshot carries its own revision; readiness requires equality. The child custom-record load is keyed by the same revision and separately records successful ownership observation. A revision mismatch disables actions immediately, even before deferred loading effects run. Mutation start has an immediate single-flight guard; parent and ownership reconciliation must finish before that guard reopens. Failed/old reads cannot certify a new revision.

The existing fetch owner gains cancellation and generation checks without a new cache/store. Reuse `readJsonOrThrow` and the shared `putModelVisibility`. Mutation responses must be read and their confirmed-save versus catalog-refresh status distinguished. Never treat abort/transport loss as a rollback. The UI keeps previous display under loading/error treatment where appropriate and has a retry path. When the removed focused chip disappears, return focus to a stable search/recovery control without stealing focus from a user who moved elsewhere.

| Action | Exact paths and ownership |
| --- | --- |
| MODIFY | `src/codex/catalog/provider-fetch.ts`: static default seed and adjacent comment, preserving forward/static/live boundaries. |
| ADD | `gui/src/provider-workspace/model-inventory.ts`: strict existing-DTO parser, provider grouping/count projection, and narrowly needed custom-response identity parsing; no network or second native classifier. Search existing owners before each helper. |
| ADD | `gui/src/components/provider-workspace/ProviderModelChip.tsx`: focused existing chip markup with accessible copy/Delete/Hide controls; authority remains in ProviderModels. This keeps its stateful parent below the 400-line limit. |
| MODIFY | `gui/src/components/provider-workspace/ProviderWorkspaceShell.tsx`: paired parent reads, revision-bound snapshot/readiness, canonical inventory counts and props. |
| MODIFY | `gui/src/pages/Providers.tsx`, `gui/src/components/provider-workspace/ProviderDetails.tsx`: pass rows/revision/readiness and existing Models navigation. Preserve keyed provider mounts. |
| MODIFY | `gui/src/components/provider-workspace/ProviderModels.tsx`: stable custom ownership, revision readiness, disjoint one-request mutations, confirmed identity, feedback/reconciliation, canonical row view and Add policy. No session-long removed-ID set. |
| MODIFY | `gui/src/icons.tsx`: source EyeOff utility icon, preserving existing icon grammar. |
| MODIFY | `gui/src/i18n/{en,de,fr,ja,ko,ru,tr,zh,zh-TW}.ts`: every displayed new label/outcome/confirmation across all nine files; retain D Logs keys. Use existing keys where their meaning fits. |
| MODIFY | `gui/tests/provider-model-custom-add.test.tsx`: preserve Add coverage, update realistic DTO/revision fixtures and the native override/ambiguous-save cases. |
| ADD | `gui/tests/provider-model-management.test.tsx`: stateful server-backed Delete/Hide/reload/recovery and asynchronous readiness/focus cases. |
| ADD | `gui/tests/provider-model-inventory.test.ts`: malformed DTO/identity, namespace collisions, unique inventory counts and successful-empty semantics. GUI tests are outside the root layout registry. |
| MODIFY | Existing workspace/Providers tests that render the touched chain: update their paired endpoint fixtures and verify counts/provenance. Only actual affected callers, found by search, are changed. |
| MODIFY | `tests/codex-integration/codex-catalog.test.ts`: static-default/retain/explicit/forward/live-empty behavior and no-network oracles. |
| MODIFY | `tests/codex-integration/model-visibility-management-api.test.ts`: actual custom DELETE then GET restoration/identity, independent hide state and unchanged target validation. |
| OMIT source hunk | `src/server/management/model-routes.ts`, `gui/src/provider-workspace/usage.ts`, `tests/server/model-discovery-management-api.test.ts`: do not add the proposed disabled-map API/parser/assertion; existing response and helper meanings stay intact. |
| MODIFY | The source's provider-reference and codex-integration guide changes in English plus fr/ja/ko/ru/tr/zh-cn/zh-tw: static seeding and existing visibility policy. |
| MODIFY | `docs-site/src/content/docs/{,fr/,ja/,ko/,ru/,tr/,zh-cn/,zh-tw/}guides/web-dashboard.md`: Delete definition versus Hide, count semantics and existing Models recovery; retain D Logs descriptions. |

Canonical count is unique non-disabled projected inventory before search and the 300-chip cap. SelectedModels remains a routed allowlist badge; native rows do not borrow a routed same-ID selection. A successful empty DTO never activates raw fallback. Native-only DTO raw IDs must not newly enter Add's duplicate set; preserve the pre-existing configured/discovered/custom and encoded-collision validation. Custom/native equal raw IDs remain distinct namespaced chips where both are projected.

## Design and verification contract

Keep the existing wrapping chip layout, typography, tokens and icons. Delete confirmation explicitly says it removes the custom definition and may reveal an underlying model. Hide confirmation explains catalog visibility and preserves direct routing policy. Keep an always-visible, keyboard-accessible Models recovery action, including empty/after-Hide/error states. No hidden panel, new deep-link protocol, additional permission flow or visual redesign.

Final GUI checks run on the remote exact branch: `cd gui && bun test --isolate tests`, `bun run lint`, `bun run lint:i18n`, `bun run build`. Root focused checks include catalog, model-discovery management, model-visibility API and the import-connected set; source-oracle/subprocess paths are explicitly covered. Root typecheck/privacy and docs build run remotely. Hosted exact-head Linux/macOS functional CI and actual target composition remain merge gates; final all-Windows dispatch remains in 060.

Browser QA uses the actual remotely compiled dashboard with an isolated synthetic management state. Capture desktop and narrow Korean layouts plus: custom-only deletion/re-add, custom/native and custom/live restoration, independent Hide and remount, existing Models recovery, error/ambiguous-save and pending-ownership states. Observe requests and resulting rows/counts; screenshots alone do not prove persistence. No real provider accounts, global proxy or deployment are touched.

Delegation after A: main owns source carry/static seed/branch/FSM/PR integration; frontend writer owns the component/helper chain; separate GUI test writer owns behavioral fixtures; catalog/API worker owns backend regression cases; docs worker owns translations and public guides; independent reviewer owns C4 identity/security and final source audit; remote QA owns exact-head execution and browser evidence. Workers inherit the model and may delegate bounded subwork; no worker mutates main FSM or pushes/merges.

## Reviewable PR layers within this work phase

Use two dependent PRs for the two capabilities in source #3659. This is one management work-phase/PABCD cycle, not the Fable cycle. Layer 1 (`codex/lane-b-04-static-default`) carries static default seeding, source catalog regressions and static-provider documentation. Layer 2 (`codex/lane-b-04-management`) builds on layer 1 and contains the canonical DTO workspace, Delete/Hide controls, UI/API regression coverage, translations and rendered evidence. Both preserve gqchen attribution. The UI layer remains one coherent interaction contract; its larger regression matrix is necessary to review the three asynchronous resources and identity boundaries together.

Main commits and publishes the static parent before switching the same bound checkout to its UI child, then delegates UI writers. No branch movement occurs under a running test/build. Verification for both prepared heads is collected in C; land the reviewed stack bottom-up (or a separately audited verified composition), retarget children before parent cleanup, and close original #3659 only after both capabilities are verified on dev. No source closure is claimed for the partial static landing.

## Structural decision and dependency map

The pressure is adding trusted row actions and refresh state to the existing 276-line ProviderModels while preserving a single server identity owner. Current edges are `ProviderWorkspaceShell -> usage/report`, `Providers -> ProviderDetails -> ProviderModels -> report/slug-codec`; `/api/models` identity comes from `src/server/management/model-rows.ts -> catalog/config`. The new parser is an HTTP read boundary, not a second identity policy.

Chosen edges: the parent and child import the colocated pure `provider-workspace/model-inventory.ts`; its ModelRow dependency is type-only from `pages/models-shared.ts`. ProviderModels imports the colocated ProviderModelChip; that leaf uses existing icons/i18n and receives callbacks, never fetches or chooses authority. No barrel/public export, runtime server-to-GUI import, shared mutable store or backend layering change is introduced. Blast radius is this provider-workspace feature and its existing prop/test callers.

The source disabled-map alternative is rejected because it duplicates native/custom identity policy and misses fallback/native state. Putting every new parser, state transition and chip into ProviderModels is rejected because it mixes response validation, authority and markup while approaching the 400-line boundary. The selected split leaves operation/state ownership visible in the existing parent/child. Existing component fetch conventions are retained rather than adding a query-library dependency or migrating unrelated server/cache ownership. Verify the paired read cost, no duplicate per-row request, exact prop callers, strict boundary parsing, focus and state generations in the planned remote tests/browser QA.

## Historical source snapshot and full source patch

Everything below is the original roadmap snapshot and public upstream diff. Its superseded two-write removal, disabled-map API, unconditional native inference and always-decrement count are not accepted implementation requirements. Active requirements are above.

Preserve original commit authors on a clean replay; for reimplementation or squash put `Co-authored-by: gqchen <276851182@qq.com>` in each carried logical commit and the final squash body. PR login alone is not an author trailer.

Safe carry strategy: main revalidates pinned source/head and incoming parent; replay the complete reviewed source series in order or reproduce its exact delta with attribution. Preserve source follow-up commits, not only the initial feature commit. Publish a child against its still-open parent; after parent squash, rebuild the child on the new dev ancestry and re-run exact-head CI. Retarget surviving children before parent branch deletion. Push uses the user's authorized `--no-verify` to avoid local hooks; this does not substitute for CI. Once dev contains the complete carried behavior, close the superseded source PR with a carry reference; do not close it for a partial/default-only slice. No linked issue is invented.

## Exact change ledger

Every source changed file is accounted for below. “Same base” means a read-only `git hash-object` of current file bytes matches the patch's old blob prefix; it does not prove future cherry-pick cleanliness. “Drift” requires contextual reconciliation. Source binary is explicitly unreviewed. All textual hunks were inspected as source behavior; appendix preserves exact before/after, including complete NEW test content. No source production file was edited.

## Execution boundary and verifier

This is a docs-only roadmap deliverable, not an implementation or merge receipt. The main agent owns 000, the goal/FSM, branch operations, integration, and final acceptance. No local tests, suites, typecheck, builds, hooks, provider requests, commits, pushes, or GitHub writes were run by this researcher. The next implementation cycle must re-read this plan against its actual parent tip.

Loop archetype: spec-satisfaction repair. Trigger: carry the pinned public source PR into lane B. Stop: required behaviors, exact-head CI, reviewer disposition and parent integration all have durable evidence. Expected result: DONE only after verified dev ancestry; NOOP only if equivalent behavior is already landed; unresolved correctness/CI evidence is pending, not DONE. Scope and unattended resource bounds are inherited from main's 000; this document does not arm or amend the goal. Upward escalation: return concrete caller/test evidence to main if the carry contract cannot be satisfied; additional worker dispatch requires main's planned scope.

CI-only verifier, inspected at the baseline below:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml:5` uses unfiltered `pull_request`, so child PR bases are supported. `changes` at lines 181-218 admits `src/**`, `tests/**`, `scripts/**`, `gui/**`; source changes also admit packaging.
- Linux `test 1/4..4/4`, lines 255-316, invokes `scripts/ci/run-bun-test-batches.sh`. That runner enumerates `tests` (line 197), admits `.test.ts` files (lines 46-68), and excludes only storage/API-usage families into dedicated jobs; the catalog/management files in this plan are included. Each actual batch runs `bun test --isolate --timeout 60000` under a process timeout (lines 121-126). Read logs to prove the named files ran; aggregate green alone is insufficient.
- `gates`, lines 390-449, runs root TypeScript (`bun x tsc --noEmit`), GUI tests (`cd gui && bun test --isolate tests`), privacy scan and skill-surface check. GUI changes additionally run `bun run lint` and `bun run build`; `gui/package.json:8` expands build to `tsc -b && vite build`. GUI lint is `oxlint .`, including changed locale/UI inputs; the separately named `lint:i18n` script is not a dedicated CI step.
- macOS runs two full-suite shards (lines 451-547). Windows full-suite six shards (lines 658-769) run only on `workflow_dispatch` with lane `all`; do not infer Windows full-suite coverage from packaging smoke or PR aggregate success. Main must obtain an exact-ref dispatch if Windows full-suite evidence is required, then verify the run head.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml:3-10,24-33` builds Astro only on main push or manual dispatch and then deploys. Normal PR CI has no Astro docs build. Do not trigger this deploy workflow merely to obtain a pre-merge check. Main must arrange an approved non-deploy CI verifier on the exact candidate commit or explicitly retain this as a readiness gap; this research does not add workflow code or authorize deployment.
- Save head SHA, parent/base SHA, run URL, executed job conclusions, named test logs, approvals and unresolved-thread disposition. Source-author reported passes are historical claims, not carried-head validation. Never attest local checks that were intentionally prohibited.
