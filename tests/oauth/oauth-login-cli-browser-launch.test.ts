/**
 * #5261 remainder: the two CLI logins that still discarded the launcher's answer.
 *
 * The landed half taught `openUrl` to say whether anything started, and the Codex account login
 * to print it. `ocx login <oauth-provider>` and `ocx login <key-provider>` kept calling
 * `void openUrl(...)`, so on a host with no browser both printed a URL, claimed to be opening
 * it, and then asked a question that assumes it opened. The user waits at a prompt that looks
 * like progress.
 *
 * What these assert is the ORDER, not merely the presence of a warning. The OAuth controller
 * does not await `onAuth`, so the launcher answers after the login flow has moved on — on a
 * callback-server provider, after it has already drawn a readline prompt. A warning that lands
 * there is written over the line the user is typing on, which is why "it warns eventually" is
 * not the contract.
 *
 * Nothing here opens a browser or attaches to stdin: both are injected, which is the only way
 * two events can be observed in sequence at all.
