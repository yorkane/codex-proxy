title: Claude Code
description: Use any routed model from Claude Code — opencodex serves the Anthropic Messages API and gateway model discovery on the same port.
---

opencodex serves `POST /v1/messages` (plus `count_tokens`) alongside `/v1/responses`, so Claude
Code can use every routed provider — OAuth logins, account pools, key failover and sidecars
included — with zero extra auth work.

## Claude OAuth account pool (experimental)

You can log in multiple Claude accounts via the Providers dashboard (`ocx login anthropic` /
add-account). By default every request uses the **active** account only.

An **experimental, opt-in** Claude account pool (`anthropicAccountPool.enabled`) adds sticky
session affinity and usage-aware new-session selection across those OAuth accounts. It does
**not** gate 429 failover: with two or more usable accounts stored, a rate-limited request moves
to another account whether the pool is on or off, and that cannot be switched off. For **new**
sessions,
`anthropicAccountPool.strategy` selects among eligible accounts: `quota` (default) picks the
lowest known usage in the window set by `quotaWindow` (`five-hour` by default, or `weekly` /
`max-utilization`) when above `autoSwitchThreshold`; `round-robin` spreads evenly
(`stickyLimit`, default `1`); `fill-first` drains the active account until cooldown,
reauthentication, or threshold, then advances. It is **off by default**, shows a GUI warning,
and is not battle-tested — Anthropic may restrict accounts that look like automated rotation;
rotation does not protect against provider enforcement.

Operational contract when enabled:

- Upstream **429** cools that account, clears its affinities, and may rotate to another eligible
  account within the same request (bounded). The cooldown uses a usable `Retry-After` when present,
  otherwise the latest valid reset time among windows Anthropic marks `rejected`, including
  weekly windows. Valid upstream deadlines are not shortened to a fixed cooldown ceiling.
  A refusal with no usable deadline falls back to a 60-second default backoff.
- Responses report the serving account's 5-hour and weekly utilization, and whichever of those
  two the response carries is recorded for that account — each window independently, and a
  refusal counts as well as a success. Usage-aware selection works from ordinary traffic,
  without waiting for a dashboard poll. Headers preserve model-specific quota windows and do
  not postpone usage probes or clear a failed usage probe's unavailable status. Measurements
  whose known reset time has passed are discarded as unknown, including retained model-specific
  windows. Values without a known reset are preserved; missing data is never reported as zero usage.
- Affinity is **process-local** (lost on proxy restart).
- **401/403** credential failures quarantine the account (`needsReauth`) so it is excluded from
  selection until re-authenticated.
- If every eligible account is cooling, the proxy returns **429** (not 401) with `Retry-After`
  when known.
- Recovery, including 429 failover, uses `quotaWindow` to rank eligible replacements without
  changing the existing cooldown or failover limits; `round-robin` ignores `quotaWindow`.
- `autoSwitchThreshold: 0` turns off **proactive** usage-based switching only. New-session
  selection and 429 recovery still consult `quotaWindow`, so the window is inert only under
  `round-robin`. `fill-first` evaluates its drain threshold in the selected window.

See [Configuration](/reference/configuration/#anthropicaccountpool-experimental).

## Quickstart

```bash
ocx claude
```

`ocx claude` ensures the proxy is running, then launches Claude Code with the environment wired:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Only when the proxy requires an API key — otherwise it is NOT set, so your claude.ai login (subscription + connectors) stays active |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY` | `1` (native `/model` picker discovery) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` | Auto-context compaction threshold (default `829800`); only injected when auto-context is enabled |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `claudeCode.model` (optional) |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | `claudeCode.tierModels.haiku ?? claudeCode.smallFastModel` (optional; legacy `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` too) |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,FABLE}_MODEL` | `claudeCode.tierModels.*` (optional) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ALWAYS_ENABLE_EFFORT` | `1` when `alwaysEnableEffort` is on (conditional) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` / `DISABLE_COMPACT` | Legacy context override when `maxContextTokens` is set (conditional) |
Variables you export yourself always win. Extra arguments pass through: `ocx claude -p "hello"`.

One exception is about *where* a variable comes from, not about precedence. The bundled Bun
runtime auto-loads a project `.env` / `.env.local`, so a stray `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the
directory you happen to launch from used to look identical to a deliberate export — and it
silently disabled a healthy claude.ai subscription in favour of API billing. `ocx claude` now
ignores Anthropic credentials that only a project dotenv introduced. A value you exported in
your shell still wins, in every auth mode. To use an API key deliberately, export it
(`export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...`) rather than leaving it in a project file.

### Native fallback when Claude routing is off

`ocx claude` used to exit with an error when Claude routing was disabled. It now launches the
native `claude` binary instead, so the command stays useful with routing off:

| Where routing is off | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `claudeCode.enabled: false` in config | Native launch, with a notice that routing is disabled |
| The running proxy reports `enabled: false` from `GET /api/claude-code` | Native launch, with a notice to restart the service after re-enabling |
| `claudeCode.enabled` absent or `true` | Routed through the proxy, unchanged |

Only an explicit `false` triggers the fallback, so a proxy predating the field stays routed. A
missing proxy is not a trigger either — with routing on, `ocx claude` still starts the proxy.

A native session must not inherit proxy state, so the fallback removes values it can **prove**
OpenCodex owns: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` only when it points at this proxy's own loopback address
and configured port *and* the paired admission token is one the proxy issued; the
`CLAUDE_CODE_*` discovery and auto-context levers; and model slots that only resolve through the
proxy (routed aliases and `provider/model` ids). Anything else is yours and is preserved — an
unrelated `http://localhost:8080` gateway and your own `sk-ant-` credential both survive.

If your saved `/model` picker default is a proxy-only model, the native session falls back to
`claudeCode.model` when that is natively usable, and otherwise warns you to pass
`--model <Anthropic model>`. An explicit `--model` argument always wins.

## Auth mode

Claude Code needs a token in `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` to talk to a gateway, but setting that
variable also disables your claude.ai login and its connectors. Which of the two you want
depends on something opencodex can look up, so by default it does.

Leave **Auth mode** on **Auto** (the default) in **Claude → Claude Code** and opencodex
decides at each launch:

| What it finds | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| A Claude login (`~/.claude.json` OAuth account, `.credentials.json`, the macOS keychain, or an exported `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) | Leaves the token unset, so your subscription and connectors keep working |
| No Claude auth at all | Injects a placeholder token, so Claude Code stops asking you to log in and routes through the proxy |
| It cannot tell (unreadable keychain, corrupt file) | Assumes subscription and prints a warning — it never moves a paying subscriber onto the proxy on a failed read |

This is recomputed every launch, not remembered, so logging in or out is picked up on the
next `ocx claude` with nothing to reconfigure.

Pick **Subscription** or **Proxy** explicitly when you want it fixed. An explicit choice is
stored in `claudeCode.authMode` and detection never overrides it — including after you log
in or out later. Switch back to Auto to hand the decision back.

On macOS, auto-connect (`claudeCode.systemEnv`) follows the same resolution, so a plain
`claude` launched outside `ocx` behaves the same way. That file is a snapshot refreshed when
the proxy starts or you save settings, while `ocx claude` always resolves live.

## System environment integration (macOS)

## Claude Desktop profile

Claude Desktop uses a separate profile from Claude Code. Open **Claude → Desktop** in the
dashboard to place each available route in one of four families: Opus, Fable, Sonnet, or Haiku.
All routes start in Opus on a new profile. The first Opus route becomes the initial overall
default, and every non-empty family always has one family default.

Drag a row to another family if you like. Dragging is optional: every row also has a visible move
control that works with a mouse, touch, or keyboard. Use **Make default** to choose a family's
default, then select **Save and apply to Desktop**. Empty families are allowed. If a saved default
is temporarily unavailable, the first available route in that family is used until it returns.

You can also manage the same profile from the command line:

The profile-editing instructions below describe the local profile. Connected remote apply is described separately below.

```bash
ocx claude desktop [apply]
ocx claude desktop show [--json]
ocx claude desktop status [--json]
ocx claude desktop move <route> <opus|fable|sonnet|haiku> [--default]
ocx claude desktop default <opus|fable|sonnet|haiku> <route|none>
ocx claude desktop export <path|->
ocx claude desktop import <path> [--apply]
```

`ocx claude desktop` and `apply` both write the current profile to Claude Desktop. `show` gives a
readable summary; `status` reports the applied profile, drift, request activity, and Windows
managed-policy health. Add `--json` for scripts. `export -` writes versioned JSON to standard output.
Import validates the complete file before saving, so an invalid file leaves the current profile
unchanged. Add `--apply` to write a valid imported profile to Desktop immediately. Use `none` only
for an empty family; every non-empty family must keep one default.

On Windows, a machine-managed Claude policy can make Desktop ignore the local third-party profile.
OpenCodex reports this as `present`; a policy it cannot read is `unknown`, which is also a warning
rather than a clean result. The diagnostic reports only that state—it does not expose policy value
names or data, and it never removes or bypasses policy. Resolve the policy with your administrator,
then fully quit and reopen Claude Desktop. Applying again also preserves profile keys that OpenCodex
does not own while refreshing its gateway and model fields.

Apply writes to Claude Desktop's real Electron user-data `configLibrary`: `~/Library/Application
Support/Claude/configLibrary` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\Claude\configLibrary` on Windows, and
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/Claude/configLibrary` on Linux. Set
`OPENCODEX_CLAUDE_DESKTOP_CONFIG_DIR` for an explicit library override or
`CLAUDE_USER_DATA_DIR` for an alternate Desktop user-data root. The legacy `Claude-3p` directory is
not read or deleted automatically.

Non-Anthropic routes receive stable aliases such as `claude-opus-4-8-2026MMDD`. The date-looking
part is a synthetic route slot, not the model's release date. Real Anthropic Claude routes keep
their real ids. New routes default to the Opus family, but moving a route does not change the
provider or model it calls. The legacy apply flags `--static`, `--hybrid`, and `--discovery-only`
remain available for existing scripts.

## System Environment Integration

When `claudeCode.systemEnv` is set to `true` (default: **off**), `ocx start` uses `launchctl setenv`
to inject `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and the related Claude Code environment variables system-wide.
New terminal windows and tabs therefore route plain `claude` commands through the proxy without
requiring the `ocx claude` wrapper. Already-open shells are unaffected and must be reopened.

`ocx stop` and proxy shutdown **unset the injected keys** (it does not restore previous values —
only the keys opencodex injected are removed). The proxy also writes `~/.opencodex/claude-env.sh`;
`ocx start` installs a `.zshrc` source hook that loads it automatically only when an executable
Claude Code CLI is present on `PATH`. Startup and `ocx ensure` remove the OpenCodex-owned hook when
Claude Code is absent or system environment integration is inactive. Claude Desktop uses its
separate profile and does not cause shell-hook installation.

Disable with `claudeCode.systemEnv: false` in the configuration or with the GUI toggle. This
feature is macOS-only; on other platforms, use `ocx claude`.

## Native Claude passthrough (subscription pierce)

With no auth override set, Claude Code keeps its claude.ai OAuth login and sends it to the proxy.
Requests for genuine `claude*`/`anthropic*` models that no alias or model map claims are forwarded
**verbatim** to `api.anthropic.com` with your credential — betas, thinking signatures, prompt
caching and billing identity stay fully native, and routed models keep working in the same session
via the picker aliases.

**Header handling:** hop-by-hop headers plus `host`, `content-length`, `accept-encoding`,
`x-opencodex-api-key`, and `origin` are always stripped before forwarding. On a non-loopback bind,
native passthrough also requires a valid proxy credential in `x-opencodex-api-key`; `Authorization`
and `x-api-key` then belong only to Anthropic. A proxy admission secret found in either provider
header is removed, while a genuine provider credential in the other header is preserved. Ambiguous
comma-joined credential headers are not forwarded.

The passthrough fires when all of these conditions are met: `nativePassthrough` is not `false`;
the model begins with `claude` or `anthropic`; the bearer token or `x-api-key` starts with `sk-ant-`;
alias/model-map resolution returns the same model unchanged; and, on a non-loopback bind, the
dedicated proxy admission header is valid. This also means the
"claude.ai connectors are disabled" warning no longer appears with `ocx claude`.

Disable with `claudeCode.nativePassthrough: false`; point elsewhere with
`claudeCode.anthropicBaseUrl`.

## Claude Desktop on a connected remote hub

When this machine is connected to a hub, `ocx claude desktop apply` (or `ocx claude desktop`)
uses the hub's Desktop model snapshot. It writes the connected hub origin and the hub-issued
model IDs into the local Desktop configuration without generating replacement aliases locally.
Static and hybrid modes copy the snapshot entries; discovery-only mode uses the hub origin
without embedding the model list.

The hub owns the Desktop profile, family assignments and defaults. Change those on the hub,
then apply again on the connected client and reselect the model in Desktop. Old aliases created
only on the client require reapply/reselection; they are not automatically migrated. Local `show`,
profile edits, and import/export remain local views and operations, not hub-profile management.
While connected, `ocx claude desktop import <path> --apply` is unsupported and refuses the import
before saving. Import without `--apply` remains local.

Apply reads the snapshot using the existing connection's data credential. It needs no admin token
and uploads no profile. If the hub is too old to support the snapshot, the response is invalid,
or no Desktop models are available, apply fails without substituting a local catalog or loopback
origin. Upgrade/configure the hub and apply again.

This alias change does not fix the separate `thinking` / `redacted_thinking` replay and prompt-cache
request in [#3719](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/issues/3719). Proxy admission alone does not enable native Anthropic passthrough; translated
Anthropic routes can still use prompt caching. Replay fidelity and cache-hit comparisons remain
separate work.

### Key rotation, recovery and disconnect

Key rotation and recovery update the credential stored in the connection-owned Desktop profile
alongside the local connection credential. No manual Desktop reapply is required just to migrate
the key. Existing model IDs, family/default choices and the user's current profile selection are
preserved; rotation does not select the managed profile again or re-enable a disabled integration.
CLI JSON `rotation: "committed"` means the new key is active. `rotation: "rolled_back"` means the
previous key was retained or restored, not that a new key was committed or the previous key revoked.
Uncertain or incomplete recovery is reported as such, rather than as successful rotation.

The first connected apply records the prior managed settings and selection for restoration.
Repeated apply and key rotation retain that original baseline. `ocx disconnect` restores the
connection-owned settings while preserving current user-added fields and unrelated profiles.
The previous selection is restored only if the managed profile is still selected; a later valid
user selection stays selected. A newly created profile with user additions is retained in readable
standard mode instead of deleting those additions. `--keep-catalog` keeps the catalog, not the
Desktop connection credential.

For an older managed profile without an original record, OpenCodex can migrate it when it
unambiguously belongs to the current hub and a recognized connection key. Apply, rotation/recovery
or direct disconnect can handle this case without a new flag or prerequisite reapply. A warning
explains that disconnect will use standard mode because the previous settings were not recorded.
That fallback removes only the connection-owned gateway settings, preserves user fields and a
separate valid selection, and is reported as standard fallback, not original restoration.

Conflicting managed fields, unrecognized credentials or damaged restoration records are preserved
and reported for resolution. Interrupted cleanup can resume for the same connection; it does not
clear a newer connection or claim completion while restoration remains incomplete. Finish pending
rotation recovery before starting disconnect, and retain the same catalog choice when retrying it.

Fully quit and reopen Claude Desktop after apply, rotation/recovery or restoration: changing files
does not replace a credential already held by the running app. OpenCodex does not kill/restart the
app automatically. Disconnect works locally without automatically revoking the hub key or erasing
arbitrary external copies; revoke separately on the hub if desired.

## The /model picker ("From gateway")

Claude Code 2.1.129+ discovers gateway models via `GET /v1/models?limit=1000` and lists them in
the native `/model` picker labeled "From gateway". Because the picker only accepts ids beginning
with `claude` or `anthropic`, opencodex exposes routed models as stable, reversible aliases:

| Surface | Format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code CLI | `claude-ocx-<provider>--<model>` (plain) or `claude-ocx2-…` (escaped) | `claude-ocx-native--gpt-5.6-sol` |
| Claude Desktop 3P | `claude-opus-4-8-<code>` (3-char base36 hash) | `claude-opus-4-8-ncb` |

The proxy picks the family per request: `?ids=cli` or `?ids=desktop` wins; otherwise the
`claude-code/*` user-agent gets the readable CLI form and other clients get the Desktop hash.
Both families decode forever — a model saved in `settings.json` under either form keeps working.
Each entry carries an honest display name such as `gemini-3-pro (gemini)`, plus full model
capabilities (reasoning-effort ladder, thinking types) in the official ModelInfo shape so Claude
Desktop's third-party gateway mode can offer its effort selector. Real Anthropic models keep their
canonical ids. The synthetic 2026 date is an internal slot, not a release date. Legacy hash aliases
and `claude-ocx-<provider>--<model>` ids from older configs still resolve.

If Claude Desktop's footer picker does not change the model for an already-running 3P
conversation, use `/model <id>` in that conversation. OpenCodex cannot observe picker state; it
routes the model id carried by each request. Confirm the result under **Logs → requestedModel**.

Models with an authoritative 1M context window get an extra `…[1m]` picker row: selecting it makes
Claude Code account a full 1M context for that model (auto-compaction stays on) — the proxy strips
the marker before routing.
Selecting one persists it to Claude Code's `settings.json` `model` field; inbound requests resolve
the alias back to the routed model. On older Claude Code versions the picker stays native — set
slots via
`ANTHROPIC_MODEL` or type any routed id with `/model` (Claude Code passes strings through).

**Alias grammar rules:** provider must not contain `/` or `--` or equal `native`.
Plain model ids (no `/` or `~`) keep the v1 prefix `claude-ocx-…`. Model ids that contain `/` or
`~` mint the v2 prefix `claude-ocx2-…` with escapes (`/` → `~s`, `~` → `~t`), e.g.
`openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` → `claude-ocx2-openrouter--anthropic~sclaude-opus-4-8`.
v1 aliases decode literally (so a historical model id that contained the two-char sequences
`~s` / `~t` is preserved); v2 aliases expand the escapes. Routes that the readable form cannot
express fall back to the hashed alias. Model ids MAY contain `--` (resolution splits on the first
`--` only); native slugs containing `--` fall back to the hashed form.

**Model resolution order:** `[1m]` marker stripped → readable alias decoded → Desktop hashed
alias decoded → `modelMap` exact match → date-stripped match (`-20250514` removed) → passthrough.

<a id="desktop-alias-resolution"></a>

An unresolved date-shaped Desktop ID can also be a genuine native model missing from discovery.
Messages and count-tokens return HTTP 503 with the fixed `desktop_model_mapping_unavailable` error when the available
evidence cannot resolve that ID; this does not establish that the model is invalid. Unknown legacy
hash aliases still return HTTP 400. Neither case strips the date or falls back to another route.
Known IDs, registered mappings and exact `modelMap` matches keep their existing behavior, including
recognized real native IDs. Refresh model discovery or reapply the connected hub profile before
trying again; retrying alone does not guarantee resolution.

Each entry carries a display name like `gemini-3-pro (gemini)`, plus full model capabilities
(reasoning-effort ladder, thinking types) in the official `ModelInfo` shape. Real Anthropic models
keep their canonical ids on both surfaces.

### Context-variant `[1m]` marker

Models with an authoritative context window of 1M (or, under auto-context, above 200k and at
least the compaction threshold) get an extra `…[1m]` picker row. Selecting it makes Claude Code
account a full 1M context. The proxy strips the case-insensitive `[1m]` suffix before alias
resolution and routing.

## Auto context (big-context models without the 200k ceiling)

Claude Code accounts 200k tokens for any model it does not recognize. **Auto context** (on by
default) fixes that:

1. Models whose real window is above 200k **and** at least the auto-compact threshold get the
   `[1m]` marker on their picker rows and env slots.
2. `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` (default `829800`, range `100000`–`1000000`) is injected so
   the conversation auto-summarizes at that point.

Three config states:

- **absent / `true`:** enabled (default)
- **`false`:** disabled — no markers, no compaction window injection
- **legacy `maxContextTokens` set:** auto-context is implicitly disabled

The compaction value is adjustable on the Claude page. **Warning:** raising it past a model's real
window breaks that model — the chat errors out before the summary can fire.

Sub-1M native Anthropic models are never auto-marked. Values you export yourself always win (the
proxy uses YOUR value to decide which models are safe to mark). Invalid hand-edited config values
fall back to 829,800.

### Effective model environment

`effectiveModelEnv` computes six slots injected by `ocx claude` / system env / shell file:
`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, four `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU,FABLE}_MODEL`, and legacy
`ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL`. The effective Haiku is `tierModels.haiku ?? smallFastModel`, fed
to both Haiku variables.

When both `tierModels.haiku` and `smallFastModel` are absent, OpenCodex leaves both helper variables unset; Claude Code then chooses its native helper model (currently Sonnet), which may incur native-provider charges.

## Roster agents (injectAgents)

Proxy startup/ensure, `ocx claude`, and relevant dashboard saves sync your featured subagent roster
(Subagents tab, up to 5 models) plus `ocx-self` into `~/.claude/agents/ocx-*.md`.

- **`ocx-self`** pins your `/model` picker default (falling back to `claudeCode.model`); omitted
  when neither exists. It does NOT use model inheritance.
- Each agent body contains an `<!-- ocx-route: <model> -->` directive — the proxy uses this to
  pin the real route. The Agent tool's `model` argument is therefore inert; pass `"haiku"` as a
  placeholder.
- Frontmatter carries the alias; routing is directive-driven.
- Only marker-verified `ocx-*.md` files containing `generated-by: opencodex` are ever
  overwritten or pruned; your own agents are never touched.
- Files are atomically synced per file (write + rename).
- `enabled: false` or `injectAgents: false` prunes all verified-owned definitions.
- GUI PUT and roster changes resync immediately; every foreground or background proxy start/ensure
  reconciles the owned files before a later Claude Code launch reads them.

Dispatch: `subagent_type: "ocx-gpt-5-6-sol"`. 1M-capable targets carry `[1m]` automatically.

## Bundled-skill elision (blockedSkills)

Claude Code's bundled `claude-api` skill injects ~840KB (~136k tokens) of Anthropic documentation
that auto-triggers on Claude model mentions. Routed models are not trained on that bundle, so by
default opencodex replaces the skill's content with a short stub on **routed** requests. Native
Anthropic passthrough is untouched.

**Two carriers are handled:**

1. **Tool-result carrier:** assistant `Skill(...)` calls — the paired `tool_result` body is
   replaced by a stub when the lowercased JSON input contains a blocked name.
2. **Text-block carrier:** a user text block ≥10,000 characters starting with
   `Base directory for this skill: ` — matched when the directory basename equals a blocked name
   (case-insensitive).

Configure with `claudeCode.blockedSkills` (default `["claude-api"]`; `[]` disables elision
entirely). The stub keeps tool call/result pairing intact.

## Model map (interception)

`claudeCode.modelMap` rewrites inbound Anthropic model ids before routing:

```json
{
  "claudeCode": {
    "modelMap": {
      "claude-sonnet-4-5": "gemini/gemini-3-pro",
      "claude-haiku-4-5": "gemini/gemini-3-flash"
    }
  }
}
```

Lookup order: discovery alias → exact id → id with date suffix stripped (`-20250514`) → passthrough.

See [Desktop alias resolution](#desktop-alias-resolution) for the rejection policy.

## Sidecar matrix: web search and image understanding

Routed models do not all have the same hosted tools or image support. opencodex fills those gaps
before the main model answers:

- The **web-search sidecar** runs the real hosted search, then gives the routed model the answer and
  sources as a tool result.
- The **vision sidecar** describes an attached image before calling a model listed in
  `noVisionModels`, then replaces the image with that description.

Both sidecars can use either backend:

| Backend | How it runs | What it requires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openai` | A small GPT model through the ChatGPT `forward` provider | A ChatGPT login and an enabled `authMode: "forward"` provider |
| `anthropic` | Claude through stored Anthropic OAuth; web search uses `web_search_20250305` and vision sends the image to Claude for description | An enabled `adapter: "anthropic"`, `authMode: "oauth"` provider whose active stored account is not marked `needsReauth` |

An explicit `backend` always wins. When it is omitted, the **web-search** sidecar always selects
`openai` (`anthropic` runs only when explicitly configured), while the **vision** sidecar selects
`anthropic` if a usable stored Anthropic OAuth account exists, otherwise `openai`. Explicitly selecting
`anthropic` without a usable credential **fails closed**: opencodex does not silently borrow
ChatGPT credentials or switch backends. The OpenAI backend likewise stays off without both login
auth and a forward provider.

Claude-inbound routed replays attach the main ChatGPT login to the internal request, so OpenAI
sidecars remain reachable even though Claude Code's inbound bearer is only the proxy credential.
That bearer is never forwarded to the routed main provider.

```json
{
  "webSearchSidecar": {
    "backend": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-5",
    "maxSearchesPerTurn": 3
  },
  "visionSidecar": {
    "backend": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-5",
    "maxDescriptionsPerTurn": 8
  }
}
```

`maxDescriptionsPerTurn` limits new image descriptions in one main-model turn. Cache hits and
duplicate in-flight descriptions do not consume the cap. Successful descriptions for `data:`
images are cached by backend, model, detail, image bytes, and request context, so the same
image-and-context pair is not described again on every replay. Remote `https:` images are never
cached because their contents can change.

See the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration/#sidecars) for every key.
Anthropic-OAuth web search and image description reuse the repository's existing Claude Code OAuth
fingerprint precedent, but should still be soak-tested with your account and workload before you
depend on them for long unattended runs.

<!-- TODO(WP5 GUI): Add the sidecar settings-screen walkthrough after the GUI controls ship. -->

## Reasoning effort

Claude Code's `/effort` setting is preserved across the adapter:

| Wire format | Mapping |
| --- | --- |
| `thinking.type: "adaptive"` + `output_config.effort` | Effort passed directly (`minimal`\|`low`\|`medium`\|`high`\|`xhigh`\|`max`\|`ultra`) |
| `thinking.type: "enabled"` + `budget_tokens` | ≤4096→`low`, ≤16384→`medium`, above→`high` |
| `thinking.type: "disabled"` | `reasoning: { effort: "none" }`; summary omitted |

The resolved value appears in the request log's **Reasoning effort** column.

## Inbound translation (Messages → Responses)

The proxy translates every Anthropic Messages API request into the Codex Responses API format:

| Messages input | Responses output |
| --- | --- |
| Top-level `system` | `instructions` (text blocks joined with `\n\n`) |
| `messages[].role: "system"` | Also folded into `instructions` |
| User text / image | `input_text` / `input_image` (base64 → data URL) |
| Assistant text | `output_text` |
| Assistant `tool_use` | `function_call` (`input` → JSON-stringified `arguments`) |
| User `tool_result` | `function_call_output` (`is_error` → `[tool error]` prefix) |
| `thinking` / `redacted_thinking` replay | `reasoning` items with bounded `ocxr1` envelopes for signatures and redacted payloads |
| Function tools | `{type: "function"}` (`web_search*` → `{type: "web_search"}`) |
| `tool_choice` | `auto`→`auto`, `none`→`none`, `any`→`required`, named function→`{type:"function",name}`, hosted WebSearch/web_search→`{type:"web_search"}` |
| `max_tokens` | `max_output_tokens` |
| `stop_sequences` | `stop` |

Replay preserves non-hidden signed blocks (including empty thinking) and opaque redacted blocks on the intended Anthropic adapter. `hideThinkingSummary` remains unchanged: locally hidden signed text is not exposed to Claude clients, and lossless replay through that hidden Claude boundary is not established. Older combined reasoning envelopes cannot recover original block order once streaming text has been emitted. `claudeCode.compatibility: "enforce"` still rejects thinking replay. This does not establish live Anthropic acceptance or cache-hit improvements; [#3719](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/issues/3719) remains open.

**Error cases (400):** malformed JSON; missing/empty `model`; missing/empty `messages`; unsupported
role; `tool_result` without `tool_use_id`; `tool_use` without id/name; named `tool_choice` without
name.

## Outbound translation (Responses → Messages SSE)

| Responses event | Messages SSE |
| --- | --- |
| `response.created` | `message_start` + `ping` |
| Heartbeat | `ping` |
| Text deltas | `content_block_start` → `content_block_delta` (text) → `content_block_stop` |
| Reasoning summary/text | `thinking` block with the replayed signature, or a bounded `ocxr1` fallback envelope |
| Redacted reasoning | `redacted_thinking` blocks replayed from the reasoning envelope |
| Function-call frames | `tool_use` block with `input_json_delta` |
| Terminal event | `message_delta` → `message_stop` |
| EOF before terminal | 502-style `api_error` |

**Stop reason mapping:** `completed` → `tool_use` (if any tool call) or `end_turn`;
`incomplete/max_output_tokens` → `max_tokens`; `incomplete/content_filter` → `refusal`.

**Error taxonomy:** 400 `invalid_request_error`, 401 `authentication_error`,
402 `billing_error`, 403 `permission_error`, 404 `not_found_error`, 409 `conflict_error`,
413 `request_too_large`, 429 `rate_limit_error`, 504 `timeout_error`, 529 `overloaded_error`,
other 5xx `api_error`. `Retry-After` is preserved.

## Prompt caching and token usage

**Anthropic-routed requests:** the adapter manages cache breakpoints for tools, system content,
and the penultimate user message, plus top-level automatic `cache_control`. Stable turns normally
produce about a 99.9% cache hit rate.

**Native OpenAI/ChatGPT routing:** derives a session-scoped `prompt_cache_key` (from
`metadata.user_id` when present, falling back to a system-content hash) and `session_id` header
for cache affinity. The cache key includes model and full tool schemas.

**Token math:** Anthropic output subtracts `cached_tokens` and `cache_write_tokens` from
`input_tokens`, exposing them as `cache_read_input_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens`.
Request logs map those back to inclusive `inputTokens`, with reads in both `cachedInputTokens` and
`cacheReadInputTokens`, writes in `cacheCreationInputTokens`. The Usage page reports cache hits
and cache creation separately.

**count_tokens:** routed models use an approximation (serialized system + messages + tools).
Native Anthropic models with an `sk-ant-` credential pass the request through to the real
Anthropic `/v1/messages/count_tokens` endpoint.

## Debug capture

`ocx debug claude on|off|status|reset`, `OCX_CLAUDE_DEBUG=1`, or `PUT /api/debug {"claude": true}`
controls inbound capture. `GET /api/claude/inbound-debug` returns `{enabled, entries}` (newest
first, ring of 20).

Each entry records: `at`, `endpoint`, `model`, `resolvedModel`, `stream`, `maxTokens`,
`thinkingType`, `thinkingBudgetTokens`, `outputConfigEffort`, `metadataKeys`,
`hasMetadataUserId`, `hasSystem`, raw `anthropicBeta`, and eight-character HMAC equality tags for
user id / system. **No prompt text, raw object, or stable cross-run hash is stored.** Disabling
Claude debug immediately clears the ring.

## GUI (Claude page)

The dashboard sidebar has a dedicated **Claude** page (below API) and a **Claude ON** toggle
(label intentionally identical in every language). The page shows:

- Inbound kill switch (enabled toggle)
- Quickstart (`ocx claude`) and manual env block
- Fast Mode selector (Auto / ON / OFF)
- Auto-context toggle and compaction threshold dropdown
- Subagent auto-registration toggle
- Model interception (modelMap) editor
- Live preview of picker aliases

`GET /api/claude-code` returns effective defaults, config, context-window registry, effective env,
available route ids, aliases, and port. `PUT /api/claude-code` is partial and preserves omitted
fields; `null` resets context/blocklist/compact-window values.

## Troubleshooting

**Claude Code says "Did 0 searches"** — Current builds translate completed Responses
`web_search_call` items into paired Anthropic `server_tool_use` and `web_search_tool_result` blocks,
including `usage.server_tool_use.web_search_requests`. Update opencodex if an older build completed
the search but Claude Code still counted zero.

**A sidecar does not activate** — For `backend: "openai"`, confirm you are logged into ChatGPT and
have an enabled `authMode: "forward"` provider. For `backend: "anthropic"`, confirm the active stored
Anthropic OAuth account is not marked `needsReauth`. An explicit Anthropic selection without that
credential intentionally fails closed.

**"claude.ai connectors are disabled"** — An `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` is set
in your shell. `ocx claude` deliberately does NOT set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; if you have it exported,
unset it. `ocx claude` injects `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, discovery, auto-context, and configured model slots — but never `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

**Models not showing in /model picker** — Verify `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1` is
set (automatic with `ocx claude`). Run `ocx claude` to refresh the gateway model cache at
`~/.claude/cache/gateway-models.json`. Check `claudeCode.enabled` is not `false`.

**Stale environment after port change** — If the proxy port changed, old shells may have a stale
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. Open a new terminal, or re-run `ocx claude`.

**200k context ceiling despite big model** — Select the `[1m]` variant in the picker, or enable
auto-context (on by default). If the picker shows no `[1m]` row, the model's authoritative context
window may be below the auto-compact threshold.

**High token count from skill loads** — The bundled `claude-api` skill (~136k tokens) auto-loads
on Claude model mentions. This is normal for native passthrough; on routed models, opencodex stubs
it by default (`blockedSkills: ["claude-api"]`).

**Subagent dispatches to wrong model** — Roster agents (`ocx-*`) use `<!-- ocx-route: ... -->`
directives, not the Agent tool's `model` argument. Make sure the directive matches the intended
route. Pass `"haiku"` as the model placeholder.
