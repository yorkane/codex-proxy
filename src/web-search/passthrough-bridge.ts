/**
 * Hosted-web-search bridge for the KEY-auth Responses passthrough (#3761).
 *
 * The Codex App always declares the hosted "{type:'web_search'}" tool. On the passthrough the
 * proxy reads that declaration as "the destination executes search itself" and relays it
 * unchanged, which is correct for the ChatGPT backend and for xAI. It is wrong for an
 * OpenAI-shaped KEY gateway that does not run the hosted tool: Ollama Cloud GLM answers with a
 * plain "{type:'function_call', name:'web_search'}", nothing on either side executes it, and the
 * undeclared-tool guard ends the turn because a hosted declaration never authorizes a client
 * function name.
 *
 * This module is the opt-in repair, armed only by "providers.<name>.webSearchBridge.enabled".
 * It intercepts that one call out of the upstream stream, runs the configured search backend
 * itself, feeds the call and its result back to the SAME upstream in a fresh POST, and shows
 * Codex the hosted "web_search_call" cell it already understands. The offending function_call
 * never reaches the client, and "web_search" is never added to the guard's allowed names --
 * doing that would authorize a call nobody can execute rather than removing it.
 *
 * Deliberate boundaries of this first slice:
 *   - Streaming SSE turns only. A non-streaming turn stays on the existing path.
 *   - A leg that mixes the search call with a client-executed tool call ends the turn ON that
 *     leg: the intercepted searches still run proxy-side so the hosted cell completes, the
 *     held client calls are released for Codex to run, and the leg's own terminal closes the
 *     turn. No continuation is sent upstream, because the client's call is unanswered and the
 *     conversation owes the client a turn, not the gateway. When the leg's terminal already
 *     ended the turn (response.failed / response.incomplete) the searches are not run at all:
 *     the opened cells close unanswered and that terminal is relayed, because billing a search
 *     for a dead turn buys nothing. What is still not fixed: the
 *     gateway never receives the executed search result -- Codex replays the hosted
 *     web_search_call cell (query and sources, no result text) on the next turn and the
 *     gateway's own function_call/function_call_output pair is not reconstructed. Making it
 *     whole needs the outbound body rewritten before the first leg is dispatched, which lives
 *     in src/server/responses/core.ts and is out of this module's scope.
 *   - Assistant text is never treated as a search instruction. The bridge intercepts structured
 *     function_call / custom_tool_call items named web_search, not XML-like prose.
 *   - Non-Ollama backends reuse the sidecar executors and those executors' own credentials.
 *     The passthrough provider's API key is sent only to an ollama search endpoint the operator
 *     authorized. A backend whose credential is missing stays disarmed rather than falling
 *     through to a different paid search.
*   - Continuation legs use a direct send rather than the core recovery ladder: the first leg
*     still goes through it, and a KEY-auth destination has no OAuth refresh path to replay.
*     The caller's outbound body ceiling is re-applied to every continuation body.
*   - The client stream is renumbered (sequence_number and output_index) because events are both
*     dropped and injected; a plain relay cannot preserve upstream numbering through that.
 *
 * The stream this module produces is ordinary Responses SSE and is handed back to the core relay,
 * so the undeclared-tool guard, the provider payload rewrites, terminal-outcome recording, and the
 * continuation cache all still apply to it. That is what keeps the guard's authority intact over
 * every OTHER call an upstream emits: the bridge removes only the web_search call it executes.
