/**
 * Does an update own the runtime it is about to stop and restart?
 *
 * Both updaters ask this: `src/update/index.ts` on the Bun path and `bin/ocx.mjs` on the
 * npm and pnpm path. It lives here as plain ESM for the same reason `stop-decision.mjs`
 * does — the Node launcher has to be able to import it, and two lanes deciding the same
 * situation separately is how a fix ships on one side only.
 */

/**
 * Decide how an update treats a runtime it may not own.
 *
 * `ocx update` replaces the package's files and then puts the proxy back: it stops the
 * running server first, and afterwards runs `ocx service repair` to re-register and restart
 * the background service. Under a desktop owner both halves are wrong. The running server is
 * the app's own bundled sidecar rather than anything this package installed, so stopping it
 * takes down a runtime the update has no way to bring back; and the repair would re-enable
 * the npm launcher the takeover superseded, which is the exact reactivation the ownership
 * marker exists to prevent. Neither half is needed either — the app updates its own runtime.
 *
 * The service registration itself is untouched in every case. It is kept by decision, not by
 * accident, so a user who later runs `ocx service install` gets their npm service back.
 *
 * THE COST OF A STALE MARKER. This reads the recorded claim, not liveness. An app deleted
 * without releasing ownership leaves a marker behind, and an update then declines to stop or
 * refresh a runtime no app is managing any more. That is the orphan-recovery cost the
 * two-record ownership design accepted; `ocx service install` clears the marker and restores
 * the ordinary path.
 *
 * The three returned flags are separate authorities, not commands. In particular, leaving
 * a runtime running is not permission to replace the package it may be executing from.
 *
 * A recorded desktop claim does not prove which binary is live. Until the bundled resolver
 * carries installation identity, it therefore blocks package replacement as well as stop and
 * restoration; the notice tells a stale-marker user how to take ownership back explicitly.
 *
 * @param {{ ownership: { owner: string, installId: string, consentGeneration: number } | null, ownershipUnknown?: boolean, serviceInstalled: boolean }} input
 * @returns {{ mayReplacePackage: boolean, mayStopRuntime: boolean, mayRestoreService: boolean, notice: string | null }}
