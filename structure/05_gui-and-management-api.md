# GUI And Management API SOT

## Dashboard serving

The bundled React dashboard is built into `gui/dist` and served by the same Bun proxy. `ocx gui`
starts the proxy when needed and opens `http://localhost:<port>`.

All ordinary HTTP responses (excluding successful WebSocket upgrades) include `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and
`Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'`. This prevents another page from framing the local
dashboard or management responses. Embedding the dashboard in an iframe is intentionally
unsupported; deployments that previously relied on such embedding must open it as a top-level page.

## Authentication boundaries

OpenCodex uses three mutually exclusive reusable admission credential classes:

| Credential class | Sources | Allowed surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data plane | `OPENCODEX_API_AUTH_TOKEN`, the `service-api-token` file loaded through `OCX_API_TOKEN_FILE`, and `config.apiKeys` | `/v1/*` HTTP endpoints and new data-plane WebSocket handshakes only |
| Management plane | `OPENCODEX_ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN` or the independent protected `admin-api-token` file | `/api/*` only |
| GUI session | A short-lived token issued only with a legitimate same-origin local dashboard page | `/api/*` only, bound to the issuing origin |

The service token file remains a delivery mechanism for the data-plane environment token; it is not
a fourth credential class. A management credential that equals any configured data-plane credential
does not enable management access. The data plane may continue to start, but `/api/*` remains closed.
CLI health collection follows the same boundary without transporting the reusable management
credential. Its local-read HMAC capability is an additional single-use, route-scoped admission
mechanism, not a reusable credential class. `ocx doctor` and OAuth health derive these capabilities
from the protected `runtime-port.json` secret for exactly two read-only GETs:
`/api/codex-auth/accounts` and `/api/system/memory`. Each capability is bound to its method, path,
nonce, proxy PID, and port. A short expiry is part of the HMAC, and the server consumes each
capability once. A capability cannot authorize another management route or survive process
replacement. These probes connect directly to the selected listener instead of delegating local
identity to an environment HTTP proxy. Their output distinguishes a missing proxy, rejected local
capability, and an unexpected management response so a reachable `401` cannot be reported as
"proxy not running." Legacy or configured-port-only listeners still satisfy ordinary liveness, but
their detailed CLI health remains unavailable until restarted with an attested runtime record and
capability-aware server.

OAuth and API-key login use the same process-bound pattern for live provider
convergence without transporting provider credentials. After the CLI durably saves
`config.json`, it challenges the exact runtime listener and sends one bodyless
`POST /api/providers/reload` capability bound to the provider name, method, path,
nonce, PID, port, and short expiry. The server consumes it once, re-reads that named
provider from the protected disk config, and updates only live state; the request
contains no provider object, API key, OAuth value, custom header, reusable management
credential, or config digest. Both the proof and reload request use the direct local
transport so environment HTTP proxies cannot observe or fabricate the exchange.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Keep a lower-privileged local process from collecting the management bearer by impersonating `/healthz` on an unused port.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: Liveness must remain public and backward-compatible, but its service string and reported PID are assertions made by the listener itself.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Require only a runtime source and non-null PID; stop showing account health; authenticate the listener with a protected per-process challenge secret.
- 선택한 방식: Store a random secret in the mode-protected runtime record and use method/path/PID/port-bound HMAC capabilities for the two CLI health reads, so the CLI sends no reusable Authorization value.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: PID and command-line checks are not cryptographic listener identity, while removing live account health would regress diagnostics unnecessarily.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: The long-lived token never reaches a listener without the runtime secret; an old running proxy remains visible but cannot provide detailed CLI account health until restarted on the new version.

Management authentication never has a loopback bypass. If no management credential is available, or
management token creation, validation, or permission hardening fails, every `/api/*` request returns
503 while `/v1/*` and unauthenticated `/healthz` continue to operate. Windows ACL hardening results
must be checked explicitly because an `icacls` timeout is a soft failure in the shared secret helper.

Local dashboard page entry requires a loopback binding, a valid parseable loopback `Host`, and an
exact request origin. A hub may additionally enable `hub.managementIngress`, a second management
surface bound exactly to `127.0.0.1` for a local Tailscale Serve or operator TLS frontend. That
listener serves only packaged GUI/SPA routes, `GET`/`POST /opencodex-session`, and `/api/*`; all data,
health, readiness, WebSocket, and unknown-static routes receive a JSON 404 before dispatch.

Tailscale identity headers authorize session issuance only when the request arrived on that specific
listener and the exact login appears in `remoteGui.allowedTailscaleUsers`. The public listener and
the unauthenticated data-loopback listener always pass `trustedTailscaleIngress: false`, regardless
of `Host`, `Origin`, `Forwarded`, `X-Forwarded-*`, or `Tailscale-User-*` values. A generic TLS proxy
cannot establish that identity and uses the existing single-use, digest-only, origin-bound pairing
exchange. Pairing accepts no admin/data credential substitute and consumes a grant only after the
full origin predicate succeeds.

The server issues a local in-memory session for five minutes or a remote session for twelve hours,
with 128 live sessions maximum. Every session is bound to the exact server and browser origins;
state-changing requests additionally require the session CSRF token. A raw admin token remains
ordinary management authority only and cannot satisfy consent routes. The dashboard never attaches
its management session to `/v1/*` requests, and pages containing a session bootstrap are served with
`Cache-Control: no-store`.

Proxy admission credentials must never reach an upstream provider. The forwarding guard rejects the
`ocx_data_`, `ocx_admin_`, and `ocx_session_` prefixes, historical keys matching
`^ocx_[0-9a-f]{40}$`, both environment tokens by constant-time comparison, and manually configured
data keys by constant-time comparison.

Admission records HOW the credential was presented, not only which one matched
(`DataPlaneAdmission.source`: `loopback | dedicated | bearer | x-api-key`). The Responses and Chat
transports accept a bearer that is one of our own admission secrets; the dedicated header still
wins when both are present, and `x-api-key` is still refused there. That admission is safe only
because `materializeCodexUpstreamAuth` SUBSTITUTES the stored main credential for it and throws
before any upstream I/O when none is usable — the forwarding guard is NOT relaxed, and widening
admission without guaranteed substitution would create exactly the leak it prevents. A bearer that
is not one of our secrets stays unadmitted and remains Codex Direct passthrough, so the two bearer
domains never mix.

Audit item #16 remains partially deferred. This credential split protects new WebSocket handshakes,
but the following established-connection controls are intentionally outside this batch and must not
be treated as implemented:

- revoke an already established connection when its data key is deleted;
- enforce an idle timeout;
- reauthenticate subsequent frames after the handshake.

## API ownership

`src/server/index.ts` authenticates and routes `/api/*`, then delegates to
`src/server/management-api.ts`, which composes the route modules under `src/server/management/`.
Codex account routes live in `src/codex/auth-api.ts` because they own the credential store, not
because they are a different plane.

The registered route set is larger than the areas described below; the code is the route SOT. What
this document owns is which module holds which area and what invariant that area must not break.

| Endpoint area | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Config/settings | Read safe config/settings views; mutate supported settings only. Full `PUT /api/config` is disabled so masked secrets are not round-tripped. `PUT /api/settings` accepts `codexAutoStart`, `streamMode`, integer `appOwnedMemoryBudgetMb` (64..4096), and/or strict boolean `codexAccountPickerEnabled` (each optional, at least one required). Picker enable initializes an empty UI-managed selector map, persists before one bounded catalog convergence, and reports only `catalogRefreshPending`; allocation/save failure restores every touched live field and skips convergence. Budget changes synchronously enforce the process-wide evictable retained-state cap; this is separate from RSS/native memory. `streamMode` persists the #314 stream-shape selection in config.json (Windows services need persisted input; macOS eager relay is explicit-only). |
| Startup safety | `GET /api/startup-health` reports whether injected Codex routing is restart-safe, with secret-free service/shim diagnostics. `POST /api/startup-action` provides allowlisted one-click installation for the background service or launcher shim. On Windows a healthy script shim is CLI-only; Codex Desktop requires the background service for full protection. |
| Windows tray | `GET/POST /api/windows-tray` controls an owned, per-user HKCU login tray. The tray delegates fixed actions to the CLI and is never a proxy supervisor or restart-protection signal. |
| Updates | `GET /api/update/check`, `POST /api/update/run`, and `GET /api/update/status` own dashboard self-update state. A launched worker PID is persisted in `update-job.json`; dead PIDs recover immediately, while legacy active records without a PID recover only after ten minutes. Live PIDs remain exclusive regardless of record age. `GET /api/update/badge` backs the sidebar badge: it reports that an update exists and links to the update surface rather than gating other actions. |
| Providers | Create/update/delete ordinary provider configs and enrich registry metadata. The reserved `openai` card exposes Pool(default)/Direct account mode; `openai-apikey` remains the separate API route. |
| Models | Fetch routed model lists, disabled model visibility, and catalog-facing ids. |
| OAuth | Login/status/logout for OAuth-backed providers, plus multiauth account management: `GET /api/oauth/accounts`, `PUT /api/oauth/accounts/active`, `PUT /api/oauth/accounts/alias`, `DELETE /api/oauth/accounts` list masked accounts per provider, switch the active one, edit its display-only alias, and remove one. The login flow itself is `GET /api/oauth/providers`, `POST /api/oauth/login`, `POST /api/oauth/login/code`, `POST /api/oauth/login/cancel`, `POST /api/oauth/logout`, and `GET /api/oauth/status`; pool controls are `GET/PUT/PATCH /api/oauth/accounts/pool` and `POST /api/oauth/accounts/clear-cooldown`. Login accepts `addAccount: true` to force a fresh browser identity. Device flows return a structured `deviceCode`; the GUI highlights and copies it before the user opens the verification page. |
| Key providers | `GET /api/key-providers` exposes API-key provider presets for setup and dashboard flows, and `GET/POST/DELETE /api/keys` owns the proxy's own admission keys. Multi-key pool per key-auth provider: `GET /api/providers/keys`, `POST /api/providers/keys`, `PUT /api/providers/keys/active`, `PUT /api/providers/keys/alias`, `DELETE /api/providers/keys` masked list, add (upsert + activate), switch, rename, and remove keys. `provider.apiKey` always mirrors the active pool entry so routing stays single-key. |
| OpenAI account mode | Report one OpenAI Codex card with Pool/Direct controls and one API-key card. Mode PATCH persists live without restart or catalog identity changes; Pool owns account/quota controls and Direct uses caller/main login only. Main-account DTOs report real credential presence and terminal `needsReauth` state instead of treating missing/invalid native auth as an unknown quota. Selection order has its own route: `PUT /api/codex-auth/accounts/priority` takes `{ id, priority }`, where `priority` is an integer -100..100 or `null` to restore the default, accepts `__main__`, 404s an unknown id, and echoes the stored value. Re-ordering never clears thread affinity, so the response carries no `appliesImmediately`, but it does release any pin — see [`08_openai-provider-tiers.md`](08_openai-provider-tiers.md) for why. `PUT /api/codex-auth/active` with a null id releases one too, but that drops the operator's account selection along with it, so this route is the only operator-facing way to clear a pin while leaving the selected account in place. `GET /api/codex-auth/active` reports `pinned`, true only while the manually selected account is still the effective active one, plus `pinnedAccountId`, which names the pinned account whether or not it is the active one. Surfaces should render `pinnedAccountId`: under round-robin and fill-first the pin caps the tier ceiling at its own tier while the strategy cursor moves freely inside that tier, so `pinned` goes false on a sibling's turn even though the pin is still suppressing every higher tier — which is why the dashboard badges `pinnedAccountId` and the GUI controller tracks only the id. `pinned` answers the narrower question of whether routing is *currently* on the operator's choice; no surface in this repo asks it, and a new one almost certainly wants the id instead. |
| Subagents | Read/write the featured `subagentModels` list capped at five ids. `GET/PUT /api/injection-model` manages the shared delegation model/effort selection, the independent OpenCodex guidance switch, and the default-off `syncCodexSubagentDefaults` opt-in for native Codex subagent defaults. When OpenCodex owns the active Codex routing, native `[agents]` defaults apply to newly created Codex tasks after sync/restart; external user-managed provider configs remain untouched. The defaults do not cause delegation and preserve existing user-owned defaults rather than overwriting them. PUT is partial-update: absent keys are unchanged, `null` clears, and non-object bodies are rejected with 400 before field validation. `syncCodexSubagentDefaults: true` requires a nonblank `model` and a supported Codex reasoning effort when effort is set; clearing `model` (null/empty) always clears effort and disables native-default sync even when the stored effort was invalid. |
| V2 / Multi-agent mode | `GET/PUT /api/v2` — reports/sets the codex `multi_agent_v2` feature flag, the 3-state `multiAgentMode` override (`v1`/`default`/`v2`), the `keepNativeChatGptOnV1` hybrid pin, and the logical maximum thread count. Selecting `v2` normally enables the native flag; with the hybrid pin it disables that global override so native rows can resolve to v1 while routed rows resolve to v2. Selecting `v1` disables the flag; `default` leaves it unchanged. PUT rejects an explicit enabled flag that conflicts with the selected mode or hybrid pin. Every transition preserves the logical thread limit, is rollback-safe, and resyncs the catalog. |
| Logs & Debug | One sidebar entry (`/#logs`) with two tabs. Logs tab: request/runtime logs for local diagnosis. Debug tab (`/#logs/debug`; legacy `/#debug` deep links redirect there): provider + usage toggles, refresh/follow log viewer. `GET/PUT /api/debug`; `GET /api/debug/logs` and `GET /api/debug/usage-logs` (monotonic `after` cursor, legacy `since` accepted). CLI: `ocx debug provider|usage …` (both streams via running proxy API). |
| Usage | `GET /api/usage` aggregate read-only summary derived from the complete `~/.opencodex/usage.jsonl`; the ledger is streamed in fixed 1 MiB chunks, so the former read-byte and parsed-row caps cannot omit its prefix. The response includes measured / reported / unreported / unsupported / estimated counts, a daily zero-filled grid, and model and provider breakdowns. Never exposes prompts. |
| System | `POST /api/system/restart` restarts the proxy in place. Local CLI/tray callers first attest the exact runtime PID and port, then send a process-scoped HMAC capability bound to that method, path, PID, and port; the capability authorizes no other management route and is invalid after replacement. The caller observes one absolute deadline and accepts success only after a different runtime PID is healthy on the same port. `GET /api/system/health` is the authenticated scalar-only identity used by shared-plane Dashboard status and restart reconnect polling; it does not widen a Remote Hub management ingress to unauthenticated `/healthz`. `GET /api/system/memory` — service-process runtime/memory identity (pid, Bun version/revision, optional `bunRuntimeSource` provenance, platform, RSS/heap/external/ArrayBuffers scalars, observed memory = max(RSS, external, ArrayBuffers), `bun:jsc` heap context, streamMode + eager-relay gate decision, watchdog snapshot sliced to the last 60 samples) plus privacy-safe `appOwnedBytes` retained-store totals/counters under static store ids. Scalar-only payload; dashboard/admin callers use the standard management gate, while `ocx doctor` may use only the exact process-scoped local-read capability. It must never move to unauthenticated `/healthz`. |
| Stop | `POST /api/stop` — restore native Codex, stop any installed service, and exit the proxy. |
| Diagnostics/sync | `src/server/management/config-routes.ts` — `GET /api/diagnostics/project-config` reports project-level Codex config that bypasses managed routing; `POST /api/sync` re-runs catalog/config sync. The diagnostic reports the bypass; it does not rewrite the project file. |
| Sidecar/shadow-call settings | `src/server/management/config-routes.ts` — `GET/PUT /api/sidecar-settings` and `GET/PUT /api/shadow-call-settings`. PUT accepts model and backend (web-search union: openai/anthropic/xai/gemini/exa; xAI is live through stored Grok OAuth, while Gemini/Exa remain inert until their executors ship) plus validated `webSearch.xSearch`, optional `webSearch.exaApiKey` (write/clear only — never echoed by GET or the PUT response; redact.ts strips it from logs), `webSearch.reasoning`, `vision.reasoning`, `vision.enabled`, `vision.maxDescriptionsPerTurn`, and `vision.timeoutMs`; the read and PUT-response payload reports model, backend, reasoning, enabled, the vision per-turn limit, and timeout. `timeoutMs` is validated against the runtime integer bounds in `src/vision/timeout-bounds.ts`. Provider/OAuth credentials live in their stores; `exaApiKey` is the one sidecar-owned secret and follows the write-only contract above. Both shadow-call responses also report the resolved `sourceModels` — the prefixes the runtime actually intercepts (`src/lib/shadow-call.ts`, default `gpt-5.4-mini` + `gpt-5.6-luna`), so no client hard-codes a helper slug that a Codex release can invalidate. |
| Storage | `src/server/management/logs-usage-routes.ts` — `GET /api/storage`, `POST /api/storage/cleanup/preview` and `/api/storage/cleanup`, `GET /api/storage/trash`, `POST /api/storage/trash/restore`, and `GET/PUT /api/storage/cleanup-policy` plus `POST /api/storage/cleanup-policy/run`. `GET /api/storage/cleanup-policy/test-stream` and `GET /api/storage/trash/restore/test-stream` exist for progress-stream testing. Cleanup takes an explicit `mode`: `quarantine` moves to trash and is restorable, `permanent` is not. The caller must name the mode — there is no default that silently deletes. |
| Provider quotas and tests | `src/server/management/provider-routes.ts` — `GET /api/provider-quotas`, `POST /api/providers/test`, `GET/PUT /api/provider-context-caps`, `GET /api/provider-presets`. A quota read may be served from cache or force-refreshed; absent quota data is reported as unknown rather than as a measured zero. |
| Models and visibility | `src/server/management/model-routes.ts` — `GET /api/models`, `PUT /api/disabled-models`, `PUT /api/model-visibility`, `PUT /api/selected-models`, `GET/POST /api/custom-models`. Visibility writes trigger catalog sync through the owning server path. |
| Effort and fallback | `src/server/management/agent-settings-routes.ts` — `GET/PUT /api/effort-caps`, `/api/subagent-models`, `/api/subagent-model-fallback`. Caps clamp; they do not reject. |
| Grok and Claude integrations | `src/server/management/agent-settings-routes.ts` — `GET /api/grok`, `PUT /api/grok/selection`, `POST /api/grok/apply`, `GET/PUT /api/claude-desktop`, `POST /api/claude-desktop/apply`, `GET /api/claude-desktop/status`, `GET/PUT /api/claude-code`. Apply writes an external app's profile, so its status probe must read the same resolved path it writes (see [`04_transports-and-sidecars.md`](04_transports-and-sidecars.md)). |
| Combos | `src/server/management/combo-routes.ts` — `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/combos` own provider combination and failover definitions. |
| Codex accounts | `src/codex/auth-api.ts` — `GET/POST/DELETE /api/codex-auth/accounts`, `PUT /api/codex-auth/accounts/alias`, `PUT /api/codex-auth/accounts/pause`, `PUT /api/codex-auth/accounts/pause-exhausted`, `POST /api/codex-auth/accounts/clear-cooldown`, `GET/PUT /api/codex-auth/active`, `PUT /api/codex-auth/auto-switch`, `PUT /api/codex-auth/pool-strategy`, `PUT /api/codex-auth/failover`, `GET /api/codex-auth/quota`, `GET /api/codex-auth/reset-credits` with `POST /api/codex-auth/reset-credits/consume`, and the login flow `POST /api/codex-auth/login`, `POST /api/codex-auth/login/code`, `POST /api/codex-auth/login/cancel`, `GET /api/codex-auth/login-status`. Account ids are opaque handles and are serialized so the GUI can address an account; emails are masked and tokens are never serialized. New-account config commits add UI-managed selector bindings in the same config save; deletion deliberately retains existing bindings for fail-closed exact routing and re-add stability. Account mutations request catalog convergence only after config durability and expose only the boolean `catalogRefreshPending` completion projection. |
| Sidebar | `src/server/management/sidebar-routes.ts` — `GET/POST /api/github/star` and `GET /api/update/badge`. Sidebar state is cosmetic; a failed fetch degrades silently. |
| Logs | `src/server/management/logs-usage-routes.ts` — `GET /api/logs`, `GET /api/claude/inbound-debug`, and `GET /api/debug/injection-logs` join the debug streams described above. |

Provider writes must not round-trip masked API keys as real secrets. Dashboard actions that change
model visibility or subagent selection should trigger catalog/cache sync behavior through the server
path that owns it.

The UI must show one provider card and one Models group for Codex-login OpenAI, describe Pool and
Direct accurately, and keep the main account inside Pool. Public model state keeps virtual Pro ids
even though transport logs may additionally report the resolved base model. Detailed rules live in
[`08_openai-provider-tiers.md`](08_openai-provider-tiers.md).

User aliases are display metadata only. Codex pool aliases live on `CodexAccount`, OAuth aliases on
`ProviderAccount`, and API-key aliases reuse the existing key `label`; account ids, credential
identity, active selection, and routing never consult these fields. The matching CLI is
`ocx account alias <provider> <id> <display-name|->` (`rename` is accepted as a synonym).

Selection order is the opposite case and must not be folded into the alias route. `codexAccountPriorities`
is routing metadata that Pool selection consults, it lives in config rather than on `CodexAccount` so the
`__main__` Desktop login can carry one, and the alias route's rejection of `__main__` would be wrong for
it. The matching CLI is `ocx account priority <provider> <id|main> [<value>]`, reading the current order
when the value is omitted. Ordering invariants live in
[`08_openai-provider-tiers.md`](08_openai-provider-tiers.md).

## Sidebar stop button

The dashboard sidebar includes a stop button that calls `POST /api/stop`. The button shows a
confirmation prompt, then fires the request and accepts the connection drop (the proxy exits). The
endpoint restores native Codex config, stops any installed service to prevent respawn, and exits.

## Bun runtime provenance

`GET /api/system/memory` may report `bunRuntimeSource` — one of `override`, `bundled`, or
`process` — describing how the **running service** obtained its Bun binary.

The value is stamped into the launched process's environment as a pair —
`OCX_BUN_RUNTIME_SOURCE` plus `OCX_BUN_RUNTIME_PATH`, the binary it was minted for — by whichever
launcher selected that binary: the npm Node launcher, the Windows Task Scheduler wrapper, the
native WinSW service, launchd, systemd, the Codex autostart shim, and the Windows tray host. Both
halves come from a single `durableBunRuntime()` resolution at each site, so the marker can never
describe a different binary than the one actually baked.

Launchers that re-exec `process.execPath` instead of resolving a binary — `ocx ensure`, GUI/Claude/
OpenCode start, `POST /api/system/restart`, and the update relaunch — go through
`withProcessRuntimeProvenance()`. An inherited marker is carried forward only when its recorded
path is the executable about to run, compared through `realpath` so symlinks, junctions, and
Windows case differences do not break a valid match. The recorded path is what settles this rather
than re-deriving the original selection: a service installed with a shell-local override keeps
neither that shell nor its `OPENCODEX_BUN_PATH`, so re-deriving would demote a correct `override`
to `process` on the first relaunch. A marker that describes some other binary — inheritance
travels down a process tree and can outlive the binary it was minted for — is dropped in favor of
what is actually executing.

The Codex shims scope the pair to their `ensure` invocation (an assignment prefix in `sh`,
`setlocal`/`endlocal` in `cmd`, save-and-restore in PowerShell) rather than exporting it. A shim
wraps the real `codex`, so an exported marker would be inherited by Codex and everything it
spawns.

**Trust rule: a reporting surface must never resolve provenance for itself.** Calling
`durableBunRuntime()` at report time answers "what would this process pick right now", which is
a different question from "what was the service started with" — and the two diverge exactly when
the answer matters, such as a `doctor` run in a shell whose `OPENCODEX_BUN_PATH` differs from the
installed service's. Read-back goes through `reportedBunRuntimeSource()`, which allowlists the
three values and returns `undefined` for anything else.

**Backward compatibility: absent is a real answer.** A service installed before this marker
existed reports no provenance, the endpoint omits the field, and consumers must say the origin is
unknown rather than infer one. `ocx doctor` relies on this to avoid its previous behavior of
telling a user to set `OPENCODEX_BUN_PATH` when the override was already active (#848). An
unrecognized wire value is treated as absent rather than passed through.

`bunRevision` remains informational and carries no capability meaning. Provenance does not feed
the eager-relay decision: the conservative `auto-known-bad` result for canary and otherwise
unvalidated Bun builds is unchanged (`src/lib/bun-stream-caps.ts`).

## Startup safety

**Startup safety** is reachable by route (`/#startup`) and rendered by the app, but it is not a
sidebar entry: it is entered from the dashboard's startup-state row, which links there whether the
current state needs remediation or merely reports how routing is protected. Its warning state is derived from active
Codex routing plus the actual service and launcher-shim installation state; the
`codexAutoStart` preference alone is never presented as proof of restart protection. The page shows
copyable repair commands (`ocx service repair` for an installed service or `ocx service install` when none is registered, `ocx codex-shim install`, and `ocx restore`). On
Windows it can also install an owned, per-user system tray. The resident tray owns only its icon,
home-scoped singleton, and HKCU Run registration; fixed proxy actions delegate to the CLI so drain,
service conflict handling, native restore, and PID identity remain centralized. Tray presence never
makes `startup.status` protected.

Windows Task Scheduler create failures must not depend solely on localized `schtasks.exe` text.
When the owned fixed-shape `/create /tn opencodex-proxy /xml ... /f` command exits with status 1,
the effective-token elevation probe may classify it as access denied only when the token is known
to be non-elevated. An unavailable probe remains `other` and cannot trigger UAC. Query, run, delete,
native-service, file-write, and foreign task failures never use this fallback.

For a fresh scheduler install whose task is proven absent, registration is the non-destructive
first phase. OpenCodex writes a unique temporary XML definition in an ACL-hardened private directory
outside its config root and asks Task Scheduler to create the owned task without running it. Only
after that succeeds may it discard
the consumed staging XML, require scheduler ownership for a config root that was absent at entry,
stop existing service managers and the proxy, remove and boundedly re-verify any native WinSW
registration, publish the canonical scheduler assets, run the task, and write install state. A
legacy non-empty unowned root remains conservatively unclaimed. This prevents the fresh path from
leaving either an unowned new installation or two registered managers that can both respawn the
proxy.
UAC cancellation or create failure removes the temporary XML before any manager/proxy stop, so the
working proxy's shutdown cleanup cannot strip Codex routing merely because elevation was refused.
The Dashboard does not apply its ordinary 60-second child timeout to this Windows service command:
killing only the CLI could orphan the already-launched elevated child, which might register a task
after the UI reported failure. The asynchronous request and install-attempt lock remain pending
until Windows returns approval or cancellation; other proxy requests keep running normally.
Existing or conflicting registrations stay on the older fail-closed path because deleting or
replacing them cannot be called a rollback without an exact prior-registration snapshot.

```text
[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Keep a refused fresh Windows service install from stopping a working proxy and removing managed Codex routing.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: The generic installer stopped service managers and the standalone proxy before the first scheduler create attempt; the Dashboard UAC path depended on assets produced by that already-destructive failure.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Reject every non-elevated caller up front, restart and re-inject after failure, snapshot every runtime/config artifact for rollback, or separate registration approval from the destructive commit.
- 선택한 방식: When scheduler absence is proven, create but do not run the owned registration from a temporary XML first; cleanup and canonical asset publication begin only after registration succeeds.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: An early rejection breaks Dashboard UAC, while a best-effort restart cannot prove that manager, proxy, and routing state were restored. The two-phase boundary makes denial/cancellation a real pre-commit failure.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Fresh-install UAC failure preserves the live proxy and routing. Failures after registration remain explicit partial-install cases, and existing/conflicting scheduler recovery remains conservative until exact prior-state restoration is available.
```

```text
[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Make Windows scheduler installation recovery work on non-English systems without broadening the commands that may request UAC.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: Access-denied classification parsed English and German stderr. Chinese OEM output decoded as UTF-8 became mojibake, so the fixed scheduler-create failure lost its machine marker and the dashboard could not select its existing elevation transaction.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Add translations and code-page decoders; elevate every scheduler failure; always launch installation elevated; or combine a native effective-token probe with the already fixed command shape and exit status.
- 선택한 방식: Preserve text detection, then use the native token probe only for status-1 creation of the owned `opencodex-proxy` XML task. Unknown probe results fail closed.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: Windows localization and OEM code pages are open-ended, while the token state and owned command shape are stable security signals already bounded by the elevated transaction protocol.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Non-English users receive stable guidance and dashboard UAC recovery. A non-permission status-1 failure from the exact owned command may be retried once elevated, but foreign operations cannot cross the elevation boundary and the elevated transaction still fails closed.
```

Dashboard updates persist their detached worker PID before returning success. This lets a later run
distinguish a live installer from a worker that crashed. Records created by older versions do not
have a PID, so they remain exclusive for a conservative ten-minute window before automatic
recovery; operators no longer need to delete `update-job.json` after a dead worker.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Prevent a crashed dashboard update worker from permanently blocking every later update.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: The job file was written before spawn, the returned PID was not persisted, and active status had no liveness or freshness check.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Require manual deletion; expire all jobs by age; or persist PID and use age only for legacy no-PID records.
- 선택한 방식: Persist and verify PID liveness, with a ten-minute fallback only for legacy records.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: It recovers known-dead workers promptly without allowing a second installer beside a long-running live worker.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: New jobs self-recover after worker death and spawn failures become visible; legacy crashes may remain blocked for up to ten minutes.

## UX boundary

The dashboard is a local control surface, not a separate service. It should reflect the same config
and catalog invariants documented in this folder rather than inventing parallel state.

## Dashboard surfaces

The sidebar exposes eleven pages (`gui/src/App.tsx` `NAV`). Several are workspace shells rather than
single forms, and the shell pattern is the part worth keeping stable:

| Surface | Shape |
| --- | --- |
| Providers | Rail of configured providers plus a detail pane whose tabs are Overview, Models, Usage, then Accounts or API Keys when the provider has an auth surface, then Settings (`gui/src/components/provider-workspace/ProviderDetails.tsx`). |
| API keys | Rail plus per-key detail; masked values only (`gui/src/components/apikeys-workspace/`). |
| Storage | Rail plus cleanup and trash detail (`gui/src/components/storage-workspace/`). |
| Subagents | Featured-roster selection workspace (`gui/src/components/subagents-workspace/`). |
| Combos | Rail, detail panel, and an add flow (`gui/src/components/ComboWorkspace.tsx`). |
| Add provider | Catalog browser plus form and OAuth panes (`gui/src/components/provider-catalog/`, `gui/src/components/AddProviderModal.tsx`). |
| Codex accounts | Account pool cards, add-account flow, switch and reset modals (`gui/src/components/CodexAccountPool.tsx`, `gui/src/components/AddCodexAccountModal.tsx`), plus the generic account-targeting picker opt-in on `gui/src/pages/CodexAuth.tsx`. Add/delete/login completion is projected to one boolean before presentation; pending catalog work is a warning, not a failed account mutation. |
| Dashboard overview | Overview, Providers, and Models tabs at the page level (`gui/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`), the 30-day token and coverage stats in the overview head (`gui/src/pages/dashboard-overview-head.tsx`), and the effort-cap, injection, maintenance, sidecar, and memory panels below it (`gui/src/pages/dashboard-overview-panels.tsx`). |

Rail selection is component-local state today, so a reload returns to the workspace's default
selection rather than the previously selected row. An OAuth ToS warning is shown before a login that
requires acceptance (`gui/src/components/OAuthTosWarningModal.tsx`).

The `/#codex-auth` add-account modal has a three-step manual-code UX contract on top of the existing
OAuth polling API: submit request, waiting-for-login completion, and terminal success/failure. Once
`POST /api/codex-auth/login/code` succeeds, the GUI must keep the input disabled, expose an
`aria-live` status message that the code was accepted, and surface repeated `login-status` polling
network failures as a visible warning instead of silently looking idle again.

Fixed provider redirect URIs keep their registered port. If that port is already in use, a login
controller with `onManualCodeInput` enters manual-only mode: it must still publish the authorization
URL and accept the final redirect URL or code through the same state/PKCE session. A controller
without manual input must fail closed; it must not silently move a fixed redirect URI to another port.

The account-targeting control reads the effective flag from `GET /api/settings`; it must not infer
state from the redacted config DTO or expose selector mappings. It renders no actionable off switch
before hydration, serializes rapid clicks, rejects stale poll results that started before a mutation,
and accepts the server-confirmed state after PUT. Product copy describes arbitrary public selectors
and exact account binding only—there are no built-in Personal/Work roles. A pending catalog refresh
keeps the saved state and renders fixed `ocx sync` guidance without server/account detail.

## Usage accounting

`src/usage/log.ts` writes append-only JSONL to `~/.opencodex/usage.jsonl` with file mode `0o600`.
An opt-in shadow-call rewrite persists the bounded, redacted original helper model as
`shadowCallRewrittenFrom`, so helper traffic remains identifiable after restart without storing
request content or inferring a helper subtype from timing.
`src/usage/summary.ts` turns that file into the `/api/usage` shape — totals, daily zero-filled
grid, model and provider breakdowns, and `measured / reported / unreported / unsupported / estimated` counts.
The management route streams the complete ledger from its beginning in fixed 1 MiB chunks on a
cold rebuild, then retains compact numeric aggregate state and resumes at the last verified LF for
ordinary appends. It does not retain the full input or a normalized object for every request, and
neither the old byte window nor the parsed-entry cap can discard an earlier prefix before range and
surface filtering. `managementUsageMaxReadBytes` remains a recognized compatibility setting for
bounded legacy readers, but it is not an accuracy limit or tuning knob for `GET /api/usage`.
A Codex-surface response also includes an `accounts` breakdown keyed by the stable non-PII
`accountLogLabel`; current cards join those rows to the management account DTO and show the 30-day
token total, API-equivalent cost estimate, and measurement coverage. New main-pool rows use `main`,
while legacy bare `openai` rows stay ambiguous rather than being reassigned from current config.
A missing `usage.jsonl` returns a zeroed summary with 200, not an error: a fresh install has no
usage and must not render as a failure. What the shape must never do is present an unmeasured
request as a measured zero — that is what the `measured / reported / unreported / unsupported /
estimated` split exists for, and why coverage is reported alongside totals. The dashboard Usage tab renders the same shape, and the
main Dashboard surfaces a 30d token / coverage summary. The in-memory `requestLog` is capped at
200 entries and is **not** the source of truth for aggregation — the JSONL on disk is.

The management API retains the compact accumulator plus bounded query summaries; it never retains
normalized per-request rows after a response. File identity changes, shrinkage, same-size metadata
changes, pricing-overlay changes, and local-time-zone changes force a cold rebuild. Ordinary growth
is treated as an append: the scanner verifies the previous LF and its trailing 64 KiB digest, then
folds only the suffix into a cloned accumulator and publishes it after validation. Concurrent callers
share that work. Cold rebuilds scan the whole ledger in fixed-size chunks and yield between bounded
batches, so memory stays bounded and unrelated management requests remain serviceable even for a
large existing log. The first read is proportional to ledger size; steady-state refresh work is
proportional to newly appended bytes. The Dashboard polls its 30-day usage summary independently once
per minute, so usage work cannot delay health/provider/settings state or run every five seconds.

`usage.jsonl` is an append-only runtime ledger. A manual in-place edit earlier than the trailing
64 KiB checkpoint followed by file growth is intentionally outside the incremental detector's
contract: validating arbitrary historical rewrites on every refresh would require rereading the
whole prefix. Replace or truncate the file, or restart the proxy, after manually changing historical
rows so the next request performs a cold rebuild.

The wire fields `historyTruncated`, `truncatedPrefixBytes`, `entriesTruncated`, and `entriesDropped`
remain in the response for compatibility with older GUI and CLI clients. A successful whole-ledger
scan reports `false`, `0`, `false`, and `0`; clients must not interpret those fields as evidence that
`managementUsageMaxReadBytes` was raised or that a bounded tail was selected.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Keep dashboard and management requests responsive as `usage.jsonl` grows.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: The append-only JSONL file remains the durable source of truth and may be truncated or replaced. A tail-only byte/row bound kept memory finite but made historical totals incomplete on busy installations; arbitrary in-place historical edits cannot be detected without rereading the prefix.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Raise the byte/row caps, retain normalized rows, maintain a second database, or stream the complete ledger into compact accumulators and cache only revision-keyed summaries.
- 선택한 방식: Stream the complete ledger in fixed 1 MiB chunks for a cold rebuild, retain only compact aggregate state plus an LF/digest checkpoint, fold verified append suffixes atomically, share concurrent work, yield during parsing, and poll usage separately at a slower cadence.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: It restores complete historical aggregation without making correctness depend on an operator-sized read limit, retaining every parsed row, or introducing a second persistence format.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Unchanged queries are cheap, normal refreshes read only appended bytes, and memory stays bounded. Cold starts and explicit invalidations still consume file-size-proportional IO/CPU. A same-inode historical rewrite outside the trailing checkpoint requires replacement, truncation, or restart to force that cold rebuild.

For diagnosing upstream-shape / usage-extraction issues run `ocx debug usage on` (or set
`OPENCODEX_USAGE_DEBUG=1` before start). The proxy then writes a rolling debug record per finalized
request to `~/.opencodex/usage-debug.jsonl` (mode `0o600`, auto-trimmed to the most-recent 100 lines
once it exceeds 200) with the upstream content-type, body kind (`sse / json / other / none`), a 2KB
body sample, and the extracted usage. Off by default; the hot path is guarded so production stays
untouched.

## Provider debug logging

Provider transport diagnostics (dropped SSE frames, adapter dial/stream events, etc.) are opt-in:
`ocx debug provider on` / `ocx debug provider off` on the running proxy, the Debug-page toggle, or `OCX_DEBUG=1` on
the next start (legacy `OCX_DEBUG_FRAMES` still enables the same path). Lines
use the `[ocx:<adapter>:<event>]` prefix, go to the proxy terminal, and are buffered for
`ocx debug provider logs` / `ocx debug provider logs -f`. Usage JSONL tails with
`ocx debug usage logs [-f]`. Separate from provider buffered logs above.

## Remote credentials and bounded sessions

Data keys authorize only the data matrix and authenticated catalog. Admin credentials authorize ordinary management and key rotation but cannot mint, exchange, or refresh a `gui-session`. Pairing grants are digest-only, origin-bound, one-use, capped at 128 live grants, burned after five grant failures, and source-limited after ten failures in ten minutes with at most 1,024 source buckets. `POST /api/session/logout` invalidates only the current origin/CSRF-authorized browser session.
