 * The stable `ocx` launcher to bake into a systemd unit, or null to fall back to the
 * Bun + CLI pair.
 *
 * `cliEntry()` resolves both of its paths from `import.meta.dir`, so they point INSIDE
 * the installed package tree. Under a version manager that tree is a versioned directory:
 * `~/.local/share/mise/installs/npm-opencodex/2.35.0/...`. An upgrade installs 2.36.0 and
 * deletes 2.35.0, after which the unit's `exec <old-bun> <old-cli>` cannot resolve, and
 * `Restart=on-failure` turns that into a restart loop (#2898). The shim in
 * `~/.local/share/mise/shims/ocx` survives the upgrade and dispatches to whatever version
 * is current, so it is the durable thing to name.
 *
 * Deliberately LEXICAL. Resolving the symlink would write the versioned target back into
 * the unit and reintroduce the bug — the indirection is the entire point.
 *
 * Only an absolute path is accepted. A bare `ocx` would be re-resolved through `PATH` on
 * every restart, which turns a service definition into a PATH-hijacking surface; naming
 * one validated absolute file keeps the target fixed at install time.
 *
 * The RECORDED launcher wins over a fresh PATH walk. `ocx service repair` runs from
 * whatever shell the operator (or `ocx update`, or a tray helper) happened to have, and a
 * context without `ocx` on `PATH` used to resolve null here — rewriting a working
 * launcher-form plist into the version-pinned Bun + CLI pair and then booting the healthy
 * job out to load it (#4236, defect 1g). A launcher that is still an executable file is
 * the thing the installed service already runs, so repair must keep naming it; only a
 * recorded launcher that has disappeared falls through to discovery.
 *
 * That preference is NOT macOS-only: `installSystemd` resolves this same function, so a
 * Linux `ocx service repair` from a PATH-less context keeps the `ExecStart` the unit
 * already has instead of rewriting it to the version-pinned pair — the #2898 shape this
 * function exists to avoid. The failure mode it prevents is milder there (systemd
 * `daemon-reload` + `restart` does not evict-then-maybe-nothing the way launchd did), but
 * the rewrite was the same, so the behavior is deliberately shared rather than branched.
