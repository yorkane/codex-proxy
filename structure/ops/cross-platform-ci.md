# Cross-platform CI

The [desktop membership contract](../runtime.md#codex-desktop-process-membership) has adapter regression coverage on every host and real PowerShell prefilter regression coverage with synthetic CIM rows on Windows in `tests/clients/desktop-app-restart.test.ts`. A skipped Windows lane does not exercise that native filter; uid-dependent POSIX cases in `tests/clients/desktop-app-restart-posix.test.ts` are skipped on Windows.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the ordinary quality gate for runtime/package changes. A pull
request verifies Linux and TypeScript: Linux runs the suite in four shards with a separate
`gates` job alongside the scoped docs, structure, packaging, keyring, and npm-global jobs. The
`platform-macos` macOS suite, the `widget` macOS widget + Tauri app-bundle build, and the
`desktop-shell` Rust toolchain build are native-gated: they run on the promotion pushes to
`main` and `preview` and on explicit `workflow_dispatch`, and on a pull request only when the
`changes` job's native path filter selects the change. `dev` pushes start nothing — dev
integration is covered by the pull-request run — while `main` and `preview` must remain push
triggers because `release.yml` requires a successful push-event run for the exact release SHA
and does not accept a pull-request run. Windows runs the full suite in nine shards only on manual
`workflow_dispatch` with `lane=all` (or an empty lane), and an aggregate green `ci` check
legitimately includes deliberate skips for every job the event did not request.

This scoping accepts a real coverage loss: a green pull request no longer proves the macOS suite,
the Rust toolchain, or the app bundle. Those regressions are caught at the promotion push to
`preview` or `main`, before publication, and on demand by explicit dispatch — a pull request
that is green is not full-platform proof.

Two paths sit outside the `ci` filter on purpose and get narrow jobs instead of the full matrix.
A change under `.github/actions/` runs `setup-action` on Linux, Windows and macOS: it runs the
composite Bun setup and requires the installed runtime to equal the version `package.json`
declares. A change under `native/remote-workspace-helper/` runs `remote-helper` on the same three
runners: `cargo fmt` on Linux, then `cargo clippy -D warnings` and `cargo test` everywhere, where
the live confinement tests compile only on macOS and Windows. Both filters also list `ci.yml`,
both stay pull-request scope like `docs` and `structure`, their outputs are validated before any
job reads them, and the aggregate gate expects each job exactly when its filter output is `true`.

`privacy:scan` runs inside `gates`, and `gates` is scoped to the `ci` filter. The `privacy
gate` job is its exact complement on pull requests — it runs wherever the `ci` filter declines —
so every pull request scans exactly once and the coverage does not depend on an enumerated path
list. The aggregate derives the same expectation from its `scoped` result.

No recovery retry can turn a failed workflow green. Linux, Windows, macOS shards and macOS control use
`scripts/ci/run-bun-test-batches.sh`, but
each lane owns its measured process shape: Linux keeps the default twelve files and 120 seconds;
Windows uses six files and 480 seconds. macOS control uses twelve files, 300 seconds and one
worker across an unsharded 1/1 selection. Windows and macOS control select all test families, while Linux leaves the
storage-policy and api-usage families to its dedicated jobs. The Windows step disables the
user-scoped test-run queue with `OCX_TEST_NO_QUEUE=1`: the batches already run sequentially in one
dedicated job, and queueing a new batch behind a surviving process from the preceding batch spends
the process timeout without executing tests. The per-process home isolation and live-home/service
manager guards remain active because the preload installs them before the lock boundary.
Test teardown follows the [sandbox cleanup contract](test-sandbox-cleanup.md).
`tests/preload.ts` resolves cleanup dependencies after home/lock admission and before test cases; teardown awaits native-main startup releases and config hardening, then the sandbox's registered ACL child reaps before removing that root. Its synchronous exit fallback leaves an undrained root for ownership-checked stale recovery instead of blocking child cleanup with removal retries. `tests/ci-workflows/test-sandbox-cleanup.test.ts` pins that ordering with a delayed reap.
`tests/helpers/test-sandbox-cleanup.ts` exposes case-scoped lifecycle ownership: cancellation starts listener stops while owned asynchronous work settles, and repeated close/stop calls share one promise. After teardown starts, only the lifecycle's own abort reason is absorbed; any other error, including a foreign AbortError, still fails its case. Callers settle that lifecycle before draining producers/reaps and restoring or removing a home. The helper does not replace fixture-specific cleanup or claim OS ACL coverage for synthetic tests.
Shard membership follows recorded duration: `scripts/ci/test-durations.tsv` weighs each file,
the heaviest file goes to the least-loaded shard, and a file without a row weighs the table's
median, so an empty table reproduces sorted round-robin exactly. Every shard computes the whole
assignment and refuses to run unless it covers every selected file once. A batch also closes
before its predicted duration passes half the process timeout, which only adds process
boundaries. `scripts/ci/test-durations.ts refresh` regenerates the table from hosted job logs.
A test failure, a process timeout and a Bun runtime crash each fail their job on the first occurrence; the
batch runner still sweeps a crashed or timed-out batch one file per process, but only to attribute a
failure the shard has already taken. The aggregate `ci` gate derives, from the event and the `changes` outputs, which
jobs this run actually requested, then requires `success` from every one of them and `skipped`
from every job the event did not request — so a job that was requested and never started can no
longer report as a deliberate skip. On a `lane=all` dispatch the gate additionally reads the
run's own job list through the Actions API and requires nine concrete successful `windows N/9`
results, because a matrix rollup can report `success` when one matrix leg is skipped. A
release that requires Windows proof still dispatches it for the exact publish SHA.
Across the jobs, the workflow runs:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun x tsc --noEmit
bun test --isolate tests
bun run privacy:scan
bun build scripts/release.ts --target=bun --outdir=.tmp/ci-release-script-check
cd gui && bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run lint && bun run build
bun run src/cli/index.ts help
```

and the Node-only global-install smoke path:

```bash
npm install
npm run build:gui
npm pack --json > pack.json
npm install -g ./bitkyc08-opencodex-*.tgz
ocx help
```

The CI intentionally does not build docs, run coverage, or perform remote Ubuntu/RDP smoke tests.
Those stay outside the default gate until a concrete regression justifies the extra runtime.

The Release workflow remains manual and publish-focused. Its `preflight` job runs right after
dispatch validation and before either packaging job: `scripts/ci/release-preflight.sh` checks the
channel and dist-tag, every version source, the tag, the GitHub release, npm, the fresh global
tag ordering and the `dev` pre-move, so a release that can never publish fails in its first minute
instead of after the packaging matrix. The workflow-level `release` concurrency group is one
constant slot shared by every ref, which serialises stable and preview runs; the preflight
therefore sees whatever the previous release run published. The publish job repeats every one of
those checks immediately before publishing, because tags, releases and registry state can still
move while a run packages, and additionally requires a successful push-event Cross-platform CI run
for the exact release commit (`GITHUB_SHA`) — a pull-request run does not qualify.
After publication the registry smoke records the npm version read-back and the dist-tag as
separate outputs, and the `release-outcomes` job, which runs after `publish` and `attach-release`
whatever their result, reports the public GitHub release, the npm version and the npm dist-tag as
separate summary rows. A row that is not confirmed warns without changing the run's result.
This keeps release runs short and makes release a deployment of a verified commit after the required
`dev` pre-move rather than a second CI pipeline.

The shared Responses path follows the [bounded multipart recovery contract](../subagents.md#multipart-encrypted-task-recovery); credential admission and retry policy remain unchanged.
