# 050 — wp3: the CI residual — a three-child test under a 15 s budget

Implementation phase. Independent of `020`/`030` (disjoint write set). Found by
dispatching the pushed branch to GitHub Actions (run 33920624827, head
`7153f247a`): windows 1/4, 3/4, 4/4 green; 2/4 = 4627 pass / 1 fail.

## The failure

```
tests\codex-retained-root-serialization.test.ts:
killed 2 dangling processes
(fail) startup and CLI sync-cache cannot write models_cache while another process owns K [15536.76ms]
  ^ this test timed out after 15000ms.

# Unhandled error between tests
215 |     holder.release();
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '...\ocx-retained-cache-3FtvI4\lock-release'
```

Not an assertion failure. Bun's per-test timeout fired at 15 s, then the
`finally` ran `holder.release()` against a sandbox `afterEach` had already
torn down — that ENOENT is a consequence of the timeout, not a second defect.

It does not reproduce on the self-hosted box: three full shard-2 runs there
passed this file every time. It is a hosted-runner-speed failure.

## What the test does inside 15 s

```
:176  holdCatalogLock   → Bun.spawn  child #1  (holds K, STAYS ALIVE; its marker waited up to 12 s)
:178  runChild          → Bun.spawn  child #2  (import src/server/index.ts, probe startServer) — unbounded await
:192  Bun.spawnSync     →            child #3  (bun run src/cli/index.ts sync-cache)         — unbounded
```

The holder boots first and remains alive while the two contenders run one after
the other, so the boot costs are additive even though the holder is concurrent.
Two of the three import the server or the CLI — the heaviest module graphs in
the repository. The file's own comment at `:99-102` records "a `bun --eval`
child on a loaded windows-latest shard takes 8-11 s just to boot and reach its
marker". Three boots cannot fit in 15 s; the budget was sized from local timing
(448 ms on macOS), the exact mistake `tests/helpers/test-budget.ts` names.

Sibling accounting, corrected by the audit: the file has six cases with
per-case budgets `15 / unspecified / 20 / 20 / 20 / 30` s. The unspecified one
(`:220`) inherits the lane-wide `--timeout 60000` from `ci.yml:655`. All
five siblings passed on the same runner at 7.1 / 10.5 / 14.0 / 4.1 / 8.2 s. The
15 s case is the only one under the line, and it is the one that failed.

## The second defect: dangling children and a teardown race

"killed 2 dangling processes" and the ENOENT are not noise. They are what a
per-test timeout does to this harness today:

- `runChild` (`:110-127`) awaits `child.exited` with no deadline, and the
  `Bun.spawnSync` at `:192` has none either. When Bun's outer timeout fires,
  both contenders can still be running — those are the two dangling processes.
- The `finally` at `:214-217` then calls `holder.release()`, which writes a
  file inside `sandbox.root` — but `afterEach` (`:163-170`) has already
  `removeTreeWithRetry`'d that root. Hence ENOENT.

A 45 s budget delays that failure; it does not remove it. The next slow runner
produces the same "killed N dangling processes" with a bigger number in the
timestamp. Both halves are fixed here, not just the budget.

### Ordering that removes the race

Cleanup has to be idempotent and owned by ONE place that both the test's
`finally` and `afterEach` can call:

1. release the holder (write `lock-release`, tolerate ENOENT)
2. kill every child spawned for this sandbox that is still running
3. `await` each child's `exited` — reap BEFORE the directory goes away
4. only then `removeTreeWithRetry(sandbox.root)`

`afterEach` becomes `async` and awaits step 3. That is the change that turns
"killed 2 dangling processes" into a clean exit under any budget.

## Why this is a budget, not a hang

`test-budget.ts` sets two conditions for raising a number:

1. **The wait is intrinsic to the assertion.** Yes: the assertion IS that a
   real startup process and a real CLI process both refuse to write
   `models_cache.json` while a third real process holds K. The processes are
   the proof; there is nothing to delete.
2. **The ablation still fails.** To be verified at B: remove
   `withCatalogWriteSerialization` from the sync-cache path and confirm the
   case goes red on `existsSync(cachePath)`. If it does not, the budget hides
   a vacuous test and the fix is different.

`SPAWN_BUDGET_MS` (45 s) is the repository's named budget for "real child
process: PowerShell, a CLI smoke test, an external binary" — this case is three
of those.

## MODIFY `tests/codex-retained-root-serialization.test.ts`

Three coordinated changes.

**(a) Track children on the sandbox, and make cleanup one idempotent function.**

```ts
 interface Sandbox {
   …
+  readonly children: Set<ReturnType<typeof Bun.spawn>>;
+  readonly releaseMarkers: Set<string>;
 }

+/** Idempotent: safe from a test's finally AND from afterEach, in either order. */
+async function teardownSandbox(sandbox: Sandbox): Promise<void> {
+  for (const marker of sandbox.releaseMarkers) {
+    try { writeFileSync(marker, "release"); } catch { /* root may already be gone */ }
+  }
+  for (const child of sandbox.children) {
+    if (child.exitCode === null) child.kill();
+  }
+  await Promise.all([...sandbox.children].map(child => child.exited));   // reap first
+  sandbox.children.clear();
+}
```

`holdCatalogLock` and `runChild` register every spawn in `sandbox.children`;
`holdCatalogLock` registers its release marker.

**(b) `afterEach` awaits reaping before deleting the tree.**

```ts
-afterEach(() => {
+afterEach(async () => {
   const identity = resolveEffectiveUserIdentity();
   for (const sandbox of sandboxes.splice(0)) {
+    await teardownSandbox(sandbox);
     const database = resolveCodexCatalogSerializationDatabasePath(identity, sandbox.codexHome);
     for (const suffix of ["", "-journal", "-wal", "-shm"]) rmSync(`${database}${suffix}`, { force: true });
     removeTreeWithRetry(sandbox.root);
   }
 });
```

**(c) The budget, with the CI run in the comment.**

```ts
+import { SPAWN_BUDGET_MS } from "./helpers/test-budget";
 …
-}, 15_000);
+// Three real Bun children (lock holder alive throughout; startup probe and CLI
+// sync-cache in series), two importing the server/CLI graphs at 8-11 s each on
+// windows-latest (:99). 15 s timed out on run 33920624827.
+}, SPAWN_BUDGET_MS);
```

The `Bun.spawnSync` at `:192` stays synchronous: it cannot be killed mid-flight,
but with (a)/(b) its worst case is now "slow", not "dangling + ENOENT". Converting
it to an async bounded spawn is a reasonable follow-up and is out of scope here
because it changes how the CLI's exit code is captured.

### Not changed, deliberately

- `waitForPath(ready, 12_000)` at `:159` stays: it is the helper's own
  diagnostic and sits inside the new budget as its comment requires.
- The sibling cases keep 20/20/30 s. They passed with margin; raising numbers
  that are not failing is the "making red go away" the helper warns against.

## Ablation, made constructible

The first draft said "bypass `withCatalogWriteSerialization`". The audit is
right that this cannot produce the red: `invalidateCodexModelsCacheWithPermit`
demands a live registered permit (`src/codex/catalog/sync.ts:1949`), so
removing the wrapper makes the write REFUSE, which is the same green.

The mutation that actually disarms K is one token in
`src/codex/catalog-write-serialization.ts:188`:

```ts
-    database.exec("PRAGMA busy_timeout = 0; BEGIN IMMEDIATE");
+    database.exec("PRAGMA busy_timeout = 0; BEGIN");           // DEFERRED: no write lock taken
```

With a deferred transaction the contender opens without contending, receives a
live permit, and writes `models_cache.json` while the holder still "owns" K.
The behavioural assertion `expect(existsSync(cachePath)).toBe(false)` at `:200`
must go red — not the source-text assertions at `:204-213`, which would stay
green under this mutation and are exactly why they are insufficient as the
gate.

## Acceptance

1. Ablation at B, on macOS: the one-token mutation above makes the case fail on
   `existsSync(cachePath)`. Reverted before commit; the revert is verified by
   `git diff --stat` showing only the test file.
2. macOS: the file passes; `afterEach` reaps before deleting (no ENOENT even if
   a case is forced to time out by temporarily setting its budget to 1 ms).
3. CI: re-dispatch on the stacked head; windows 2/4 SUCCESS, this case's
   recorded duration under `SPAWN_BUDGET_MS` with margin, and no "killed N
   dangling processes" line in the job log.

## Stack position

Third commit on `codex/260905-windows-suite-stabilization`, after the two
harness fixes. Independent of them, ordered by discovery.

## Second CI round: the budget moved the failure one case down the file

Run 33923803071 (head `7dc9d622f`): windows 1/4, 3/4, 4/4 green; 2/4 red again,
still 4627 pass / 1 fail, still this file — a different case:

```
(pass) startup and CLI sync-cache … owns K            [18743.00ms]   ← was the failure; now passes
(pass) native restore … owns K                        [5726.56ms]
killed 1 dangling process
(fail) POST /api/sync … newer convergence catalog     [20140.28ms]   ← timed out at 20 s
(pass) POST /api/sync … newer retained catalog        [11876.76ms]
(pass) a persisted runtime selection …                [2289.08ms]
(pass) two processes at the post-approval seam …      [5623.21ms]
```

The first case ran 18.7 s — it would have died under the old 15 s and lived
under 45 s, so the fix did what it claimed. The convergence case is the same
shape (a `Bun.spawn` of the management API, `:342`, plus a publisher child,
`:288`) with a 20 s budget that this runner exceeded by 140 ms.

Also notable: the shard as a whole was ~2× slower than the previous run (18.7 s
vs 15.5 s on the first case with the SAME fixture), so the hosted runner's speed
varies run to run and the margins in this file are all thin.

## What I got wrong in the first round

I budgeted the ONE case that had failed. The audit flagged "raising one case to
45 s while its siblings stay at 20-30 s" and I answered that workload differs per
case. That was true and beside the point: every case in this file boots the same
kind of child on the same runner, and the sibling budgets were sized the same
way the 15 s one was. Fixing the case instead of the class is how the failure
moved rather than stopped.

## Amendment: budget the class, and bound the children

### MODIFY `tests/codex-retained-root-serialization.test.ts` — all four
explicit budgets become `SPAWN_BUDGET_MS`

| line | case | today | after |
|---|---|---|---|
| `:255` | startup + CLI | `SPAWN_BUDGET_MS` (done) | — |
| `:376` | POST /api/sync ×2 (`for` loop) | 20 s | `SPAWN_BUDGET_MS` |
| `:460` | runtime selection moved | 20 s | `SPAWN_BUDGET_MS` |
| `:639` | post-approval seam (3 children) | 30 s | `SPAWN_BUDGET_MS` |

The unspecified case at `:220` (native restore) inherits the lane's 60 s and
is left alone.

Every one of these spawns at least one real Bun child that imports the
server, the CLI, or the convergence graph. Under `test-budget.ts` they are the
same category — "real child process" — and the budget name says so. The
ablation from the first round (BEGIN IMMEDIATE → BEGIN) already establishes
that K is real for this file; the sibling cases assert on the same lock.

### MODIFY — register every spawn with the sandbox

The teardown from the first round only reaps children that were added to
`sandbox.children`. `runChild` and `holdCatalogLock` register; the four
inline `Bun.spawn` calls at `:342`, `:421`, `:489`, `:551` do not. "killed 1
dangling process" in this run is one of them. Each gets a
`sandbox.children.add(child)` immediately after the spawn, so a timeout in any
case reaps cleanly.

### Acceptance, amended

1. macOS: file passes, `typecheck` clean.
2. Forced 1 ms budget on the convergence case: fails cleanly, no dangling
   process, no unhandled ENOENT.
3. CI re-dispatch: windows 2/4 SUCCESS with **no** "killed N dangling processes"
   line in the log, and every case in this file under its budget with margin.

---

## Third CI round: all four Windows shards green

Run 33926041666 (head `cfc8de963`):

| shard | pass | fail | dangling |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1/4 | 4462 | **0** | 0 |
| 2/4 | 4628 | **0** | 0 |
| 3/4 | 4305 | **0** | — |
| 4/4 | 4413 | **0** | — |

The file that failed twice, on the same hosted runner class:

```
(pass) startup and CLI sync-cache … owns K            [8459.45ms]   (was 18743 / 15536 timeout)
(pass) native restore … owns K                        [2935.56ms]
(pass) POST /api/sync … newer convergence catalog     [7303.73ms]   (was 20140 timeout)
(pass) POST /api/sync … newer retained catalog        [9908.46ms]
(pass) a persisted runtime selection …                [1772.21ms]
(pass) two processes at the post-approval seam …      [3383.29ms]
```

Every case is under `SPAWN_BUDGET_MS` with 4-5× margin, and this run happened
to be a fast one (8.5 s where the previous run took 18.7 s for the same case).
That spread — 8.5 to 18.7 s for identical work — is the thing the 15 s and 20 s
budgets could never absorb, and it is why the class fix mattered more than the
first case fix.

### What was actually wrong, in one paragraph

Not the product. Not the lock. The file's per-case budgets were sized from a
~450 ms local run for work that costs 8-19 s on the hosted Windows runner, and
its harness had no reap-before-delete ordering, so any budget miss produced a
dangling child plus a follow-on ENOENT/unhandled-rejection that obscured the
real message. Three commits: a budget on one case (moved the failure), then the
class budget + child registration + a detached barrier race (fixed it).

### Verification ledger for the barrier fix

The unhandled-rejection claim was checked by a probe, not by reading: insert a
5 s sleep after the barrier under a 3 s budget. Original code reports the
timeout **plus** `Unhandled error between tests: sync exited before provider
barrier (143)`; fixed code reports the timeout alone. Two earlier attempts at
the fix (resolve-to-Error, catch-in-finally) still produced the unhandled error
under that probe and were discarded before commit. The probe was removed and the
file is 6/6 on macOS.
