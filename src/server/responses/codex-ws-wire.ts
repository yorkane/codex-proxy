 * on the direct path receives a gateway status in this situation and retries under its own
 * policy; this response restores that equivalence. The resend is forbidden by the
 * non-replayable marker instead (see upstream-retry.ts), and the structured code lets the
 * combo failover reach the same verdict after it re-parses the body.
 *
 * 504 is the origin's silence (nothing at all, or nothing but liveness, for the tolerated
 * window); 502 is a transport that closed or misbehaved after the send. Both carry the
