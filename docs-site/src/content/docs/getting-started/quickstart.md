description: Configure your first provider and route OpenAI Codex through opencodex in three commands.
---

This guide takes you from a fresh install to running Codex against a non-OpenAI model.

## 1. Run the setup wizard

```bash
ocx init
```

`ocx init` walks you through:

1. **Pick a provider** — choose one of the 79 built-in registry presets or `custom` to type a base
   URL and adapter.
2. **API key** — paste a key, or reference an environment variable like `${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}`.
3. **Default model** — for key, local, and custom providers, accept the preset or enter a model id.
4. **Proxy port** — defaults to `10100`.
5. **Inject into Codex?** — on a normal loopback setup, opencodex adds a root `openai_base_url` to
   `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` (default `~/.codex/config.toml`) so Codex's built-in `openai` provider
   targets the proxy. Remote/LAN binds use a dedicated provider entry with an API-auth header instead.
6. **Install the autostart shim?** — when enabled, launching `codex` runs `ocx ensure` first.

The result is saved to `$OPENCODEX_HOME/config.json` (default `~/.opencodex/config.json`).

`ocx init` creates a config only when none exists. An existing valid config is kept and setup
exits; use `ocx config` or the dashboard to update it. Invalid, unreadable, or symlinked config
entries are preserved and reported as errors. If another process creates the config during the
wizard, its file wins and setup stops before backup housekeeping or integration prompts.

EOF or Ctrl+C before creation cancels setup. Cancellation after creation keeps the saved config.
Initial publication requires hard-link support and permission on the config filesystem; failures
stop setup without falling back to an overwrite. If publication or temporary-file cleanup cannot
finish, inspect the config directory before retrying: a complete config or private temporary file
may remain.

:::note[GPT-5.6 rollout entries]
The current stable release seeds GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna for ChatGPT passthrough, OpenAI API-key,
OpenRouter, and
the experimental Cursor adapter. They work only when that upstream account has access. The OpenAI
API-key and OpenRouter presets advertise a 922,000-token usable context window; Cursor keeps its own
adapter metadata.

## 2. Start the proxy

```bash
ocx start            # defaults to port 10100
ocx start --port 8080
```

On start, opencodex:

- writes its PID to `~/.opencodex/ocx.pid` (and refuses to start twice),
- discovers live models where the provider supports it and **syncs native and routed entries into
  Codex's model catalog**,
- listens on `http://localhost:<port>/v1`.

If the requested port is busy, `ocx start` selects a free port, records it in `runtime-port.json`,
and updates Codex to use the live listener.

Check it:

```bash
ocx status
ocx gui       # open the dashboard on the live port
```

## 3. Use Codex

Codex now talks to opencodex transparently:

```bash
codex "Refactor this function for readability"
```

To target a specific routed model, use the `provider/model` form Codex's model picker shows:

```bash
codex -m "anthropic/claude-opus-5" "Explain this stack trace"
codex -m "ollama-cloud/glm-5.2"      "Write a SQL migration"
```

## Choose sub-agent models (optional)

A fresh config features five native models in Codex's sub-agent picker: `gpt-5.5`,
`gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`, and `gpt-5.4-mini`. Open `ocx gui` to replace or
reorder up to five native or routed models. The dashboard can also set one preferred sub-agent model
and reasoning effort. See [Sub-agent Surface](/guides/sub-agent-surface/) to choose v1/base/v2 and
understand when guidance, native defaults, and fallback apply.

## Logging in instead of pasting a key

Some providers support real account login (OAuth, auto-refreshed):

```bash
ocx login xai          # or: anthropic, kimi, kiro, google-antigravity, cursor
ocx logout xai
```

OpenAI itself needs **no key** — the default provider forwards your existing `codex login`
credentials straight through (see [Providers](/guides/providers/)).

## Stopping & restoring

```bash
ocx stop          # stop the proxy and restore native Codex
ocx restore       # restore native Codex without stopping (alias: ocx eject)
ocx restore back  # route Codex through the still-running proxy again
```
