/**
 * One logical request, one execution budget (#4546).
 *
 * The amplification behind #4546 was never a single missing limit. Every layer that can
 * re-send a request -- transport retry, adapter retry, auth recovery, account failover, combo
 * failover, repair -- counted its own allowance, so a per-layer 3 composed into a per-request
 * 12. #4605 and #4608 gave the transient layers one shared counter; this module is the policy
 * that counter answers to.
 *
 * The policy is an INTERSECTION of constraints, not four independent counters. A request that
 * still has total allowance left is not thereby entitled to a second account move, and a
 * request that changed credentials does not get its target-transition allowance back. The
 * default profile keeps the recovery shape that actually works today -- three same-account
 * sends plus one alternate -- by funding the alternate from a reserve that a validated
 * sanitized repair can spend instead, but never both.
