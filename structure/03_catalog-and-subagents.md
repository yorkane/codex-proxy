# Catalog And Subagents SOT

## Shared catalog

`src/codex/catalog.ts` builds a shared Codex-shaped catalog for CLI, TUI, App, and SDK. It:

- preserves native OpenAI entries from the live catalog or static fallback, and emits
  gpt-5.6 natives from the pinned upstream models.json snapshot
  (`src/codex/data/upstream-models.json` — exact per-slug ladders: luna has no ultra);
- upgrades either an observed selector-qualified `*/gpt-daybreak-blue-latest` account row or an
  explicitly configured canonical `openai/gpt-daybreak-blue-latest` Codex-forward row from the
  pinned Sol capability metadata while preserving its selector and Daybreak wire identity;
  this never expands the bare/API-key model lists or rewrites the wire model to `gpt-5.6-sol`;
- clones a native template for routed `provider/model` entries;
- forces strict Codex catalog fields required by the current parser;
- hides `disabledModels` without blocking direct routing (routed provider ids are excluded;
  account-qualified native ids hide only that selector row; BARE native slugs hide the bare row
  and all account-selector clones and drop that model family from raw `/v1/models`);
- applies exact provider/model compatibility exclusions after live discovery and metadata
  augmentation, so upstream-advertised but uncallable rows never enter dashboard or Codex pickers;
- strips native-only service tier and WebSocket metadata unless the final routed provider/model
  explicitly enables the verified OpenAI-compatible service tier;
- backs up the pristine catalog once per catalog: the copy is keyed by a hash of the catalog path
  (`catalog-backup-<id>.json`), and the legacy unsuffixed `catalog-backup.json` is retained in
  addition for the default catalog, so a restore resolves the backup for the catalog it is restoring
  rather than assuming a single file;
- invalidates `$CODEX_HOME/models_cache.json` when model visibility changes.

On the default `opencodex-catalog.json` path, sync deliberately uses two catalog sources: Codex's
bundled catalog supplies a current native entry template, while the actual on-disk catalog supplies
the rows being merged. This split is required because empty or partial provider discovery must
preserve routed entries and genuine user-native rows from the file that will be overwritten; a
bundled catalog never contains those rows. Retained sync and evidence-bound convergence share an
explicit observed-state merge policy and restore native priorities from the once-only pristine
backup rather than from a catalog whose priorities may already have been rewritten. A configured
custom catalog remains the native metadata/template authority even when a bundled-catalog memo is
warm. Both paths may use an admitted matching bundled memo only as installed-runtime capability
evidence to remove unsupported reasoning efforts; convergence never probes Codex itself.

Custom Astra and Daybreak rows acquire native reasoning capability only through the existing
canonical `openai` forward destination and explicit capability-source predicate. The shared
custom-row producer bounds their merged effort lists against pinned per-model Codex metadata,
preserves an explicit empty list without a default, and recovers an incompatible nonempty list
to the native default singleton. A default must belong to the projected list. Other custom rows
keep their declaration precedence; a GPT model name, display alias, or arbitrary gateway is not
native provenance. Stored configuration and native capability maps are unchanged.

The observed-state merge tracks the current invocation's freshly generated custom row objects
after detaching its inputs. Those rows already own their complete reasoning projection, so the
merge does not append `max` again. This also keeps a generic none-only custom row none-only;
ordinary retained provider rows still receive the existing mock-tier policy. A persisted custom
marker alone never grants this exemption. Both gather entry points, retained sync, management
convergence and direct Codex model discovery use the same producer. The legacy runtime effort
union clamp remains separate; it is not a per-model or per-client-version grammar oracle.
Existing thread settings and the reported Desktop 0.153.4 gateway rejection require separate
runtime evidence. Codex's native `ultra` mode is preserved and is not a literal API wire promise.

When account selectors are enabled, the sync path may also observe exact, visible, API-supported
OpenAI-family ids from Codex's user-owned catalog/cache. Only rows with native catalog provenance
are trusted; unknown ids are carried through startup cache invalidation as hidden observations and
are emitted only as selector-qualified rows whose account provenance matches. They never expand
the bare native or API-key model list. This keeps account-scoped upstream ids such as
`gpt-daybreak-blue-latest` callable without treating them as a static release allowlist.

Account-gated native ids are a stricter subset. Their authenticated ChatGPT `/models` roster is
cached per credential generation with a bounded timeout. A bare gated row is emitted only when at
least one confirmed eligible account reports it; a selector-qualified row is emitted only when the
mapped account reports it. A failed or malformed discovery is not positive evidence and therefore
hides the gated row until a later refresh. The same snapshot gates Pool selection, so the catalog
and runtime cannot disagree by advertising through one account and dispatching through another.

The app-server's model list comes from this shared catalog, not from patching the App. Codex Desktop
may still apply its remote native-only allowlist after `model/list`; an explicitly configured combo
`nativeAlias` is the bounded compatibility path. It replaces one supported bare native row with a
routed, labeled row, routes the bare id before canonical OpenAI, and keeps account-qualified native
selectors genuine. Missing target discovery capabilities inherit the replaced native row's metadata,
while explicit target limits remain authoritative. Because the affected renderer ignores `visibility: "hide"`, the presence of any
native alias also omits disabled bare native rows from the effective catalog. Dashboard rows remain
derived from the static native set, and sync retains bundled/pristine native recovery sources so a
later re-enable or alias removal restores native metadata.

Provider live-model lists are cached with a configured TTL (`src/codex/model-cache.ts`). Adding,
deleting, or editing a provider's shape clears that per-provider cache; a disabled-only change
deliberately does not, because a disabled provider is already excluded from the catalog gather
instead. Codex's own `models_cache.json` is a different cache, invalidated by catalog refresh.

For `liveModels: false`, a static provider publishes the ordered union of `models` and
`retainModels`. When `models` is absent or empty, its configured `defaultModel` seeds that
union before retained ids; a nonempty explicit list does not import a different default.
Without any default or configured/retained ids, the static result stays empty. The existing
forward-auth native path remains separate. Static gathering does not refresh OAuth or call
the provider's model endpoint, and normal selection and visibility filters still apply.

The provider workspace uses the existing `/api/models` projection for displayed rows,
model identity and inventory counts. Counts cover distinct non-disabled selectors within
each provider, before search or the render cap; they are not selected-model or live-discovery
counts. The full available list and discovery provenance remain separate inputs.

Deleting a custom definition uses its stable record id and does not also hide the underlying
model. Native or discovered metadata can therefore reappear without changing the inventory
count. Hide uses the represented row's native/routed identity and changes visibility only.
The Models page can restore existing hidden rows; adding a definition does not implicitly
clear a previous hide or provider allowlist. Actions wait for current row and custom-ownership
observations, and mutations reconcile those observations instead of retaining browser-only
removal markers. These presentation operations do not grant routing or account entitlement.

### Windows request-path catalog-state discovery

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Prevent Windows PowerShell/CIM process discovery from blocking Bun's event loop while v2 sub-agent guidance is assembled.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: The stale-catalog check is advisory on the request path, but CLI/service lifecycle operations use the same process evidence before warning or terminating narrowly matched app-servers.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Remove stale-catalog guidance, move every platform collector into workers, or isolate only the Windows request path behind asynchronous child processes.
- 선택한 방식: Keep the synchronous fail-closed collector for explicit lifecycle operations; v2 requests use asynchronous trusted-System32 PowerShell, one identity-scoped in-flight refresh, and the existing short cache. Cache invalidation advances a generation so a pre-write CIM result cannot repopulate post-write state.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: This preserves process ownership and matching invariants while preventing a slow CIM query from starving `/healthz` and unrelated proxy traffic.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Concurrent v2 turns do not multiply CIM walks and the event loop remains responsive. A cold request can still await the bounded advisory check, and collection failure suppresses OpenCodex-authored model guidance as `unknown`.

## Startup readiness

Each `startServer` invocation owns a private, one-shot readiness gate created before the listener
binds. `handleStart` supplies its gate and transitions it only after the shared catalog sync and
best-effort Claude Code roster reconciliation have both settled. The catalog sync remains the
authority for ready versus failed; a roster warning does not make an otherwise healthy proxy fail.
Calls without a supplied gate receive a fresh private gate that intentionally remains pending. Only
`ok: true` with no nonempty warning becomes ready; `null`, a throw, `ok !== true`, or a nonempty
warning becomes failed. State is isolated per server instance.

Exact unauthenticated `GET /readyz` returns sanitized identity fields plus pending, ready, or failed:
`200` for ready, or `503` with `Retry-After: 1` for pending and terminal failed. The full CLI syntax
is `ocx ready [--json] [--wait [--timeout <seconds>]]`. The probe validates the service, version,
uptime, PID, port, status, and HTTP/status pairing. The default is one probe. With `--wait`, it
applies one absolute deadline (45 seconds by default) across discovery, readiness probes, polling,
and sleeps, but exits immediately on terminal failed. `--timeout <seconds>` requires `--wait` and
accepts positive integer seconds from 1–300. CLI `--json` emits
`{ready, status, pid, port}`, with status in `ready|pending|failed|unreachable`. Exit 0 means ready;
exit 1 covers not-ready, pending, failed, timeout, and unreachable; exit 64 means invalid arguments.
Older proxies without `/readyz` fail closed as unreachable. `/healthz` remains the separate
liveness contract.

## Entry shape

Routed entries keep Codex-required metadata such as reasoning levels, shell type, API support flags,
base instructions, modalities, auto-compact fields, and strict parser booleans. The public slug uses
the canonical `provider/model`. Its display name uses the provider's exact `modelDisplayNames` override first,
then trusted catalog metadata such as a configured qualified provider/model alias, then the public slug.
This overlay never changes route identity or the upstream wire model, and its catalog fingerprint makes
a label edit refresh Codex output.

Supported bare native GPT rows also consume `providers.openai.modelDisplayNames`. Retained sync
and convergence pass the same map to the observed-state merge. After native normalization and
ordering, the merge applies the exact nonblank trimmed label and saves
`opencodex_native_display_name: { slug, original, applied }` in the local catalog only. The next
merge detaches its inputs, removes that marker, and restores `original` only if the native slug
still matches and the current name equals `applied`. Removing or blanking the override therefore
restores the owned name before normal native metadata upgrades. Divergent external names remain
subject to those upgrades: Astra still replaces non-pinned names with its pinned native name.
Template-derived rows discard the marker. The overlay leaves model IDs, metadata (including
capabilities), ordering, routed combo aliases, custom rows and account-qualified rows unchanged;
it does not relabel HTTP model listings or virtual `*-pro` rows.

## Native passthrough

Astra has its own pinned native row: 272,000 default context, 872,000 opt-in ceiling,
low-through-ultra effort, low default, and native multi-agent effort `xhigh`. The native-alias
fallback passes the same configured limits to context, max input and compaction. Unrelated routed
templates clear the native multi-agent effort; canonical Astra-forward custom rows retain it and
the pinned Fast speed description. Sync repairs only the exact old built-in Astra Fast description,
preserving custom descriptions and other stored row fields.

The API registry separately owns Astra's 1,050,000 context / 922,000 input / 128,000 output and
five API effort levels. Trusted discovery snapshots carry the output ceiling as well as input
and context, so reconstruction cannot drop it. User output limits may only lower that ceiling.
Pricing remains provider-scoped and API-referenced for every built-in dollar estimate, including
Codex-login routes. Both OpenAI identities use the same Astra/Sol API base and cache prices,
API Fast multipliers and published long-context bands; Fast stacks with long context for Astra,
GPT-5.6 and the Daybreak Blue selectors. No subscription-specific exception or credit multiplier
enters the estimate. Explicit user price overrides remain authoritative. See the public provider
reference for the dated source table.

Native bare OpenAI entries form one `openai` group. The provider's Pool(default)/Direct option
changes account selection without changing those ids; `openai-apikey/<model>` creates the separate
API-key identity. The API GPT-5.6 rows use 1,050,000 context / 922,000 max input; their `*-pro` virtual rows
rewrite to the base upstream model with `reasoning.mode: "pro"` while public state keeps the virtual
slug. Routed non-OpenAI models must not
inherit native-only service tier or WebSocket metadata unless the user explicitly enables that
capability. Detailed invariants live in [`08_openai-provider-tiers.md`](08_openai-provider-tiers.md).

Native passthrough entries depend on the enabled provider set. With at least one enabled provider,
they appear only while an enabled canonical OpenAI forward provider exists — disabling every such
provider removes the native rows rather than leaving entries that resolve to no credential. With no
enabled provider at all, the native rows remain as bootstrap so a fresh install still has something
to route.

## Accounts, namespaces, and pool rotation

Pool mode routes across main plus added Codex credentials. Key rules:

- **A namespace is a public selector mapped to an internal target.** Generated selectors are how a
  caller names an account — the main login's selector is `main` (collision-suffixed if taken),
  which maps to the config-only sentinel `@main`; the sentinel deliberately sits outside the
  pool-account id grammar. Selector initialization requires an explicit opt-in and fills only an
  absent or empty map; a non-empty user map keeps its object identity and insertion order. Generated
  selectors avoid provider, combo, routing-policy, and slash-qualified routing-profile namespaces.
  Collision checks normalize provider and reserved namespace keys, while account and
  routing-profile selector prefixes are exact-case (`src/codex/account-namespaces.ts`,
  `src/codex/account-namespace-match.ts`, `src/routing/profile-namespace.ts`).
- **Selector labels carry no account-role semantics.** When at least one selector is advertisable,
  the Codex catalog clones each supported native row per selector and hides the bare picker rows;
  bare ids remain routable and stay in raw `/v1/models` unless explicitly disabled. Missing stored
  account targets are not advertised, and private account ids never become catalog labels.
  `codexAccountPickerEnabled: false` hides generated rows without deleting exact routing bindings;
  an omitted flag preserves the established behavior of a nonempty hand-written selector map.
- **Rotation is sticky.** A conversation stays on its selected account while that account is
  usable; failure moves it, success does not (`src/codex/pool-rotation.ts`).
- **The credential store is generation-guarded.** A refresh takes a lock and persists only if the
  generation it started from still holds; a lost race raises a generation-conflict error rather
  than overwriting the newer credential (`src/codex/account-store.ts`). Callers handle that error;
  they do not assume a silent retry.

Warmup issues a bounded request with a fallback model so a cold account reports usability before a
real turn depends on it (`src/codex/warmup.ts`).

## Multi-agent surface mode (3-state)

`OcxConfig.multiAgentMode` controls the `multi_agent_version` field stamped on catalog entries:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `"v1"` | Force ALL entries to `multi_agent_version = "v1"` — overrides upstream pins (sol/terra included). |
| `"default"` (install default) | Respect upstream model pins (sol/terra=v2, luna=v1, others=null → codex feature flag decides). On sync, stale forced values are cleared and upstream pins restored. |
| `"v2"` | Force ALL entries to `multi_agent_version = "v2"` — overrides upstream pins (luna included). |

The override is applied as a final pass in both `buildCatalogEntries` (live `/v1/models` path) and
`mergeCatalogEntriesForSync` (on-disk sync), AFTER all normalization and visibility processing. This
ensures `normalizeRoutedCatalogEntry` (which deletes `multi_agent_version` from routed entries) does
not clobber the forced value.

CLI: `ocx v2 mode v1|default|v2`. GUI: segmented control on the Models page. API: `GET/PUT /api/v2`
with `multiAgentMode` field.

The `multi_agent_v2` feature flag and the logical maximum thread count are separate from
`multiAgentMode` (`src/codex/features.ts`): the mode decides which surface Codex advertises, while
the flag and thread count decide what the native runtime allows.

`keepNativeChatGptOnV1` makes mode `v2` a catalog-driven hybrid: OpenCodex disables the global
`multi_agent_v2` override because codex-rs resolves that override before a model row's explicit
`multi_agent_version`. Native ChatGPT rows then select v1 from the catalog and routed rows select
v2. An explicit attempt to enable the global flag while the hybrid pin is active is rejected.

### What the five-model `spawn_agent` window is, and how V1 differs from V2

`MAX_SPAWN_AGENT_MODEL_OVERRIDES = 5` (mirrored in `src/codex/catalog/sync.ts`) is **not** a
subagent concurrency limit and **not** an eligibility limit. Upstream uses it in exactly two
places: the model list rendered into the `spawn_agent` tool description
(`multi_agents_spec.rs:789`) and the "Available models:" suggestions in an unknown-model error
(`multi_agents_common.rs:448`, inside the `ok_or_else` closure that runs only *after* the lookup
already failed). The success path `find_spawn_agent_model_name` (`:431-442`) scans the whole
catalog with neither the cap nor a `show_in_picker` filter, so a model outside the advertised
five is still accepted when named exactly.

Three different numbers, often conflated:

| Quantity | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Models **advertised** as overrides | `min(5, picker-visible eligible rows)` | `multi_agents_spec.rs:785-790` |
| Models **eligible** as targets | no numeric cap (only `"disabled"` is excluded, and only on V2) | `multi_agents_common.rs:36-42` |
| **Concurrent** subagents | V1 6 children (root excluded); V2 total 4 including root → 3 children | `config/mod.rs:211-212`, `:1497-1506` |

**The cap is the same 5 on both surfaces, but the window's contents are not.** The eligibility
filter runs *before* `.take(5)`, and it behaves differently per surface: on a V1 call
`model_supports_multi_agent_backend` short-circuits true for every row (including `disabled`
ones), while a V2 call drops `Some(Disabled)` first — which lets a later row move into the five.
Same catalog, different advertised list:

| # | Model | pin | V1 advertises | V2 advertises |
| ---: | --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | `v2-a` | `v2` | ✅ | ✅ |
| 2 | `disabled-a` | `disabled` | ✅ | — |
| 3 | `v1-a` | `v1` | ✅ | ✅ |
| 4 | `null-a` | absent | ✅ | ✅ |
| 5 | `v2-b` | `v2` | ✅ | ✅ |
| 6 | `disabled-b` | `disabled` | — | — |
| 7 | `null-b` | absent | — | ✅ |

opencodex already matches this: `effectiveSubagentRoster` filters with
`surface !== "v2" || isEligibleV2SubagentEntry(entry)`, so the V1 path skips the eligibility
filter exactly as upstream does. opencodex also injects no roster on V1
(`src/server/responses/collaboration.ts` emits only proactive text at the top effort tier), so
the upstream tool description remains the authority there.

Two further V1/V2 differences worth knowing: the list gate is
`hide_agent_type_model_reasoning` on V1 (hard-coded `false` at registration, so V1 always
advertises) but `expose_spawn_agent_model_overrides` on V2 (default `true`; when false the list
is omitted *and* the `model`/`reasoning_effort` schema fields are removed). And V2's
`hide_spawn_agent_metadata` defaults true, which removes `service_tier`.

`modelPickerOrder` (#1649) separates **OpenCodex guidance** from native advertisement.
`SPAWN_PRIORITY_FIELD` preserves the natural priority used by `effectiveSubagentRoster`, so
OpenCodex's preferred/guidance candidate calculation stays independent of display order.
Native Codex ignores that private field: its advertised five on V1 and exposed V2 follow the
native `priority` and may change when the picker is reordered. Exact-name override lookup is
not restricted to those five advertised rows. V1 receives no OpenCodex preferred-roster
injection; V2 can additionally receive natural-priority guidance when its catalog state permits.
The helper tests pin guidance behavior, not native tool-description equivalence.

A nonblank bare id in `modelPickerOrder` opts into complete-picker display ordering. Exact
ids take precedence over raw/encoded equivalents; routed-only and empty lists keep the legacy
ordering behavior. This does not change the separate `opencodex_spawn_priority` contract.
Retained rows recompute their natural ranks from the current featured roster and account-selector
stride before display order is applied, so a discovery outage cannot preserve an obsolete
featured or picker rank. Canonical `opencode-go` rows retain their configured reasoning ladder
both when generated and when merged from retained catalog state; synthetic max/ultra choices
are not added to that provider's declared ladder.

## Routed tool discovery and hosted search

All routed catalog rows advertise `supports_search_tool: true` together with
`tool_mode: "code_mode_only"` — the pair is load-bearing. The field selects Codex's deferred
tool-discovery surface; it does not describe the hosted web-search sidecar. Under code mode,
deferred MCP tools remain callable through exec's `tools` global / `ALL_TOOLS` without a
`tool_search` round-trip (upstream codex-rs code_mode suite; live canary 2026-08-13: routed
kimi/k3 executed `tools.mcp__node_repl__js`, devlog `260813_tool_catalog_deferral/010+020`).
Stamping `false` instead forces every MCP declaration into `exec.description` — a measured 2.7x
turn-1 payload regression (96,699 → 258,929 chars). For Cursor this can also make the unified
`exec` exceed the 120,000-byte serialized `McpTools` ceiling; the budget then drops `exec` and
its companion `wait` (#1830). Hosted search remains independent: non-Cursor routes keep
`web_search_tool_type: "text_and_image"`, while Cursor omits it because runTurn bypasses the
search sidecar.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: keep routed plugin/MCP tools reachable without paying the full-catalog turn-1 payload tax or starving Cursor's unified execution bridge.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: #1596 restored deferred discovery only for non-Cursor rows because Cursor bypasses the hosted-search sidecar; codex-rs treats deferred exposure and hosted search as separate capabilities, and Cursor independently enforces a 120,000-byte serialized tool-catalog limit.
- 검토한 주요 대안: keep Cursor opted out, raise/disable Cursor's transport ceiling, synthesize another execution bridge, or enable Cursor-native local exec only when the bridge disappears.
- 선택한 방식: enable Codex deferred exposure for Cursor code-mode rows too, while continuing to omit Cursor's hosted `web_search_tool_type`.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: it removes the known exec-description inflation before Cursor budgeting without weakening the measured transport limit, inventing caller tools, or turning bridge absence into local-execution authority.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Cursor keeps a compact Responses-owned `exec` path under rich tool catalogs and hosted-search behavior remains unchanged; the existing Cursor budget and native-local-exec fail-closed policy remain authoritative.

## Ultra reasoning level

Ultra is always advertised in the catalog regardless of the `multi_agent_v2` toggle. The v2 toggle
controls only the multi-agent collab surface, not ultra visibility. The `nativeEffortClamp` function
wire-clamps ultra/max to each model's real top rung (e.g. gpt-5.5 ultra → xhigh on the wire).

`effortCap` and `subagentEffortCap` are hard ceilings applied on the V2 path
(`src/server/effort-policy.ts`): they lower or preserve the requested effort rather than rejecting
the request, and they never raise it.

The `ocx effort` CLI accepts only the same canonical cap ladder before live probing or persistence.
Its status output preserves unsupported legacy cap values and reports that those fields are ignored;
the read does not normalize or migrate them, and an ignored subagent field does not disable a valid
main cap. Injection-effort input remains a separate contract.

Operator-owned `pinnedReasoningEffort`, `modelPinnedReasoningEfforts`, and root
`modelPinnedEfforts` resolve before applicable effort caps at the final destination.
Provider model pins precede provider-wide pins, then global selector/destination pins.
A pin can raise the effective caller effort; the later cap can still lower or omit it.
`none` means explicit-effort omission (provider default), not guaranteed reasoning disablement.
Compaction maintenance is exempt. Pins are user overlays and do not alter registry seeds,
model discovery or advertised ladders. Native Chat normalizes newly pinned values through
provider wire mapping; unpinned native requests retain their existing pass-through contract.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Xiaomi MiMo의 공식 OpenAI Chat endpoint가 실제로 받지 않는 `max`/
  `ultra` reasoning tier를 catalog에 노출하지 않도록 한다.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: `xiaomi`는 Anthropic endpoint, `mimo`는 token-plan endpoint를
  소유하며, 공식 `https://api.xiaomimimo.com/v1`은 generic custom provider로 처리됐다.
- 검토한 주요 대안: 기존 `xiaomi`/`mimo` contract를 확장하기, 모든 custom provider의 ladder를
  일괄 축소하기, 공식 public endpoint만을 별도 registry row로 소유하기.
- 선택한 방식: `xiaomi-mimo`를 고정 목적지의 `openai-chat` preset으로 등록하고
  `low`/`medium`/`high`만 노출하며 높은 direct request는 `high`로 clamp한다.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: 서로 다른 auth/wire/host를 하나의 preset으로
  합치지 않으면서 upstream error로 확인된 계약만 적용할 수 있다.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: 공식 endpoint에서 안전한 picker/wire 계약을 제공하고,
  `preserveCustomDestination`으로 같은 이름의 다른 host/key를 보호한다. 대신 새 preset 표면을
  문서와 registry parity에서 함께 유지해야 한다.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Xiaomi token-plan에서 image input을 거부하는 `mimo-v2.5-pro`만 vision
  sidecar로 우회하고, 실제 image input을 받는 `mimo-v2.5`는 native vision 경로에 남긴다.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: upstream `/v1/models`는 input modality를 제공하지 않으며,
  `noVisionModels`는 text-only 모델을 sidecar로 보내면서 Codex catalog에는 image input을
  광고하는 provider-scoped 계약이다.
- 검토한 주요 대안: MiMo 전체를 text-only로 분류하기, live discovery에서 modality를
  추측하기, `mimo-v2.5-pro` 하나만 registry에 고정 분류하기.
- 선택한 방식: canonical `mimo` preset의 `noVisionModels`에 `mimo-v2.5-pro`만 추가한다.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: live endpoint 검증으로 확인된 최소 범위만
  적용하며, 정상 동작하는 `mimo-v2.5`의 native image 경로를 훼손하지 않는다.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Pro image 요청의 404를 sidecar 설명 경로로 바꾸고 base 모델은
  그대로 유지한다. `preserveCustomDestination` guard 때문에 같은 provider id를 다른 host에
  연결한 사용자 설정에는 이 capability 분류가 전파되지 않는다.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: GitHub Copilot의 live model catalog가 명시하는 모델별 image-input 지원을
  Codex catalog에 정확히 보존한다.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: 공용 discovery parser는 직접 `capabilities.vision`과 표준 modality
  필드는 읽었지만 Copilot의 `capabilities.supports.vision` 중첩 boolean은 읽지 않아 모든
  Copilot 모델이 text-only fallback으로 축소되었다.
- 검토한 주요 대안: 모든 Copilot 모델에 정적 vision seed를 추가하기, 모델 이름을 외부
  metadata alias에 연결하기, live 모델별 boolean을 공용 parser에서 해석하기.
- 선택한 방식: 직접 vision boolean이 없을 때만 중첩 `supports.vision`의 명시적 boolean을
  사용하고, `false`도 보존하며 malformed 값은 추론하지 않는다.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: live 응답이 모델별 capability의 가장 좁은 근거라서
  새 모델에도 적용되며 text-only 모델을 image-capable로 과장하지 않는다.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Copilot vision 모델은 image attachment를 받을 수 있고 명시적 text-only
  모델은 계속 차단된다. Capability를 제공하지 않는 모델은 기존 fallback을 유지한다.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: bare `defaultModel` selectors that route into third-party providers must keep their
  adapter-owned effort ladder; only true ChatGPT-native requests should receive the mock-max repair.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: `nativeEffortClamp` already needed the original request id because
  routing strips `provider/`, but bare third-party selectors like `glm-5.2-fast-preview` still look
  native after that strip.
- 검토한 주요 대안: (1) infer nativeness from the bare slug prefix alone, (2) gate clamping by the
  resolved provider identity, (3) disable the clamp for all off-snapshot slugs.
- 선택한 방식: request-time clamp entry is allowed only when the resolved route is the canonical
  built-in OpenAI/Codex forward provider and the original request id is still bare.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: provider identity is the only durable signal that
  distinguishes true native ChatGPT traffic from third-party `defaultModel` routes when both share a
  bare model id shape.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: preserves `gpt-5.5 max -> xhigh` repair for native traffic, removes false
  clamps for bare routed models, and keeps adapter-specific effort mapping as the single source of
  truth for third-party providers.

## Subagents

New non-OAuth provider registrations carry `initialModelSelection` with a unique
registration identity. Until reliable live/static discovery completes, public
catalogs and model candidates withhold those providers' models; the provider itself
stays active. At 20 or more canonical Models switch rows, initialization appends
all corresponding disabled selectors once. Existing registrations and later manual
choices are not reinitialized. OAuth/ChatGPT forwarding is exempt using the same
usable-key override predicate as routing. Display aliases do not add switch rows.

`src/providers/initial-model-selection-runtime.ts` commits the decision against a
matching registration/inventory snapshot before catalog authority is captured.
Ordinary management discovery also completes it with Codex integration OFF. The
final catalog merge fences pending retained rows, including delete/re-add recovery.
Raw management rows remain visible as pending/OFF. Config listener bindings are
excluded from inventory identity because live and persisted bindings may differ.

Codex `spawn_agent` advertises only the highest-priority first five picker-visible catalog rows.
Use at most five configured `subagentModels` ids; they may contain bare catalog ids, routed
`provider/model` ids, or exact account-qualified `<selector>/<native-openai-model>` ids. The
dashboard offers bare native and routed choices; exact account-qualified choices are configured
through `ocx agent subagents set` or the opencodex configuration.

When account selectors are active, one featured bare native id expands into a complete selector row
group. Catalog priorities use the selector count as a stride so each group stays together without
widening Codex's five-row advertisement window. Fresh defaults are Astra, Sol, Terra, Luna, 5.5.
Startup upgrades unmarked rosters once: prepend `gpt-6-astra`, retain the first four unique
non-Astra choices, then move retained bare `gpt-5.5` last. The old fifth choice is dropped;
an unmarked empty list becomes Astra only, and an unset list receives the fresh defaults.
`subagentModelsVersion: 1` records completion, so later user edits (including an empty list or
removing Astra) persist. The migration rebases on the latest disk config under the existing
mutation lock; failed persistence degrades to an in-memory roster for that run without a stale
whole-config overwrite. Existing disabled-model visibility rules remain unchanged.

Quota-aware fallback walks a configured chain when the featured model is exhausted, probing
availability on a bounded interval (default 60 s, `src/codex/subagent-model-fallback.ts`). It rewrites
the requested model id only; effort remains owned by the caps described under
[Ultra reasoning level](#ultra-reasoning-level).

`injectionModel` and `injectionEffort` are shared selections with two independent consumers.
`multiAgentGuidanceEnabled` controls only OpenCodex-authored delegation guidance.
`syncCodexSubagentDefaults` is a separate, default-off opt-in that applies the selected values to
Codex's native `[agents]` defaults on sync/restart for newly created Codex tasks when OpenCodex owns
the active Codex routing; external user-managed provider configs remain untouched. It does not itself
cause delegation. The TOML edit owns only marker-tagged values, preserves existing unmarked
user-owned `[agents]` defaults rather than overwriting them, and rejects ambiguous table shapes
without changing the file.

V2 proxy guidance uses `<opencodex_subagent_guidance>` for both built-in metadata and
custom `injectionPrompt` bodies. The built-in text reports the resolved preferred model,
effort, roster and fallback chain without prescribing delegation, spawn overrides or
`fork_turns`. Custom bodies retain their placeholder behavior. The guidance switch and
catalog-state gates still apply; stale or unknown catalog state suppresses proxy guidance.
V1 uses the shared `MULTI_AGENT_MODE_HINT_RECOMMENDATION.text` inside `<multi_agent_mode>`
at `max` or `ultra`. Only the separate explicit delegation-request trigger changes; user,
authority, task-scope and collaboration-tool rules remain applicable. This is guidance,
not an enforcement mechanism or a change to native settings or tool access.

Replay deduplication compares the latest exact generated developer text separately for
each tag family, preserving built-in → custom → built-in transitions without duplicating
unchanged proxy metadata after a native policy change. Native and legacy-tagged history
remain intact: tags do not establish historical authorship or revoke old instructions,
and mixed-version transition detection is not guaranteed.

The native mode hint is separate from proxy guidance and native `[agents]` defaults.
`src/codex/multi-agent-mode-policy.ts` owns the proactive recommendation; the dashboard
obtains it from `/api/v2` rather than maintaining its own preset. An explicit dashboard,
API or CLI hint write passes through `setMultiAgentModeHintText`, which replaces only
the two byte-exact released OpenCodex presets with the current recommendation. Other
valid custom text, including whitespace variants, is preserved. Reads, unrelated writes
and upgrades do not migrate stored hints. The writer retains its native capability check
and stores only `features.multi_agent_v2.multi_agent_mode_hint_text` in Codex TOML;
`null` removes that key. The hint affects new native Codex sessions when their v2 surface
is active, without changing reasoning effort or the proxy guidance switch.

Claude Code `ocx-*` agent definitions consume the same effective `claudeCode.blockedSkills` policy
as inbound bundle elision. When the list is non-empty (default: `claude-api`), generated definitions
whose marker-stripped model resolves to a routed id receive a preventive instruction not to invoke
those skills. Direct `provider/model` selectors are routed even when their inbound resolution is
identity. The only unguarded `ocx-self` case is an identity-resolved `claude|anthropic` model while
native passthrough is enabled; `modelMap` claims and `nativePassthrough:false` restore the guard. The
guard avoids creating oversized skill messages before the proxy can intervene; inbound elision remains
the fallback if a client still sends a blocked bundle. An explicit empty list disables both routed-model
behaviors.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: keep generated Claude Code `ocx-*.md` roster files synchronized when the proxy is
  started or ensured on Linux, Windows, and macOS, including background service restarts.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: explicit `ocx claude` launches and Management API writes reconciled the
  files, while the startup call inside `injectSystemEnv` ran only on macOS with system-env enabled.
  `startServer` is also used as an in-process library/test primitive and cannot safely mutate the
  real user home on every invocation.
- 검토한 주요 대안: write from `startServer`; duplicate hooks in each OS service manager; reconcile
  once from the owning CLI lifecycle after the listener becomes available.
- 선택한 방식: the foreground/service start and live-proxy ensure paths call one best-effort helper
  after bind, using the live Management API context-window map and the existing marker-verified
  atomic roster writer. macOS system-env startup keeps its existing shared-window sync and skips the
  duplicate call.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: it covers every supported service entrypoint without
  adding home-directory side effects to server-library consumers or creating a second roster format.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: stale OpenCodex-owned definitions converge on every daemon start, disabled integration
  prunes them without provider discovery, and catalog failure falls back to unmarked definitions so
  startup remains available. A later dashboard save or `ocx claude` launch restores missing context
  markers after a transient failure.


### Saved picker presets

The Models page saves routed snapshots in `modelPickerOrder` and records their origin in
`modelPickerOrderMode` (`alphabetical`, `provider`, `most-used`). Mode is UI provenance, not a
catalog sorting policy: catalog writers consume the saved array. Routed-only featured/native
bands and complete-picker natural-rank preservation remain as described above. Public
`buildCatalogEntries` accepts the order as its final argument and applies the complete-order
pass after building. On-disk convergence retains its existing post-merge final pass.

Claude ModelInfo ordering receives optional `{ modelPickerOrder, featured }` after `fastRows`.
It orders routed output groups after alias deduplication, preserving the collision winner and
base/1M/Fast siblings. Native groups and explicit Desktop profile ownership are unchanged.
Native Codex advertisements still follow display priority; private guidance ranks do not freeze them.
