# xAI Grok Provider

Native result continuations and function-result injection follow [the mode-specific result and control contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#experimental-native-function-result-injection); this surface does not infer upstream support or alter its defaults.

Native steering follows [the shared WebSocket contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#experimental-native-mid-turn-steering); this surface's defaults remain unchanged.

xAI uses the same shared credential and delivery policies through the Responses
[core module ownership](../transports/responses.md#core-module-ownership). This surface retains its existing behavior.

One Responses capability is seeded for xAI alone: `requiresPairedResponsesToolResults`, which
answers a replayed tool call whose output never arrived. It is deliberately not the same flag as
`requiresAdjacentResponsesToolResults`, which xAI also carries and shares with the Kimi presets.
The contract for both, and the reason they do not collapse into one, is specified in
[chat-compat](./chat-compat.md); it is not restated here.

The configuration-only [plaintext V2 contract](../subagents.md#plaintext-v2-agent-messages)
is scoped to canonical ChatGPT Responses forwarding; other source-area behavior described here is unchanged.

Codex-native retirement is scoped to OpenAI catalog/quota evidence. Shared Responses handling
retains xAI provider behavior; see
[the catalog boundary](../catalog.md#shared-catalog).

Shared parsing and streaming follow the [request-copy](../transports/byte-accounting.md#request-copy-accounting) and [stream-buffer accounting](../transports/byte-accounting.md#stream-buffer-accounting) contracts. Response-attached WebSocket telemetry follows the [stage record identity contract](../transports/responses.md#passthrough-sse-stream-shapes-314).

## xAI Grok hardening (official Grok Build contract parity)

Grok's Responses path shares `src/responses/apply-patch-envelope.ts` for freeform restoration.
The declared `input` field remains authoritative; alternate-field and outer-fence recovery is
limited to unambiguous bare `exec` and `apply_patch` calls and does not rewrite foreign grammars.

Grounded in the open-sourced official client (xai-org/grok-build); unit + evidence:
`devlog/_fin/260716_grok_build_hardening/`.

The shared Responses path follows the [bounded multipart recovery contract](../subagents.md#multipart-encrypted-task-recovery); credential admission and retry policy remain unchanged.

- **Reasoning folding:** the Responses parser folds `reasoning` items into the FOLLOWING
  assistant turn (`pendingReasoning` in `src/responses/parser.ts`) so the Grok chat wire carries
  ONE assistant message with `reasoning_content` ??exact-prefix cache stability. Unsigned
  siblings newline-join; `ocxr1`-signed siblings stay separate parts (Anthropic replay keeps
  each signature on its own text); boundaries (user/tool-result/agent) clear pending state;
  call items fold pending reasoning into the same turn.
- **Grok CLI credential ownership:** `source:"local-cli"` xAI credentials re-read
  `~/.grok/auth.json` (read-only) before any refresh and adopt a newer usable generation with
  zero IdP calls (`shouldAdoptGrokGeneration`, later-expiresAt authority); an IdP refresh
  detaches the credential to `source:"oauth"`.
- **Browser login callback:** Grok's browser login uses the shared `OAuthCallbackFlow` listener
  on a per-provider FIXED loopback port, so every response it sends closes its connection. A
  retired flow that kept a pooled socket would capture the NEXT login's callback and reject it
  as a state mismatch; see `src/oauth/callback-server.ts`.
  Provider token-body budgets are separate from this shared callback lifetime. The
  [OrcaRouter bounded key-exchange contract](../transports/inventory.md#bounded-response-ingestion-and-orcarouter-login)
  is owned by its login consumer and does not impose that budget on Grok token grants.
- **Two-lock refresh transaction:** per-provider+account intent lock held across the IdP
  exchange plus a short global store-write lock + async mutation funnel around every
  `auth.json` load-merge-persist (`src/oauth/store.ts`); generation-guarded persist
  (`expectedGeneration` ??superseded adoption), conditional `needsReauth`, bounded jittered
  retry for transient token-endpoint failures.
  Newly created legacy-store recovery copies follow the [backup ownership contract](../config.md#restore);
  an ownership-registration failure (a `false` return or thrown error) warns without discarding downgrade recovery.
- **Reactive 401 replay:** both the adapter recovery loop and native Responses passthrough branch
  force-refresh once (singleflight, generation-checked) and replay OAuth-backed xAI requests
  exactly once with a re-resolved transport; API-key/BYOK paths are excluded
  (`src/server/responses/core.ts`).
- **Header parity:** per-attempt `x-grok-req-id` (fresh UUID inside the transport fetch
  wrapper), stable session/conv affinity headers, always-set User-Agent, and a single
  compatibility profile const for the Grok client version (`src/providers/xai-transport.ts`);
  `fetchWithHeaderTimeout` takes an executor so provider fetch wrappers stay inside the
  timeout race.

The generated Grok client marker also enables a client-facing sparse-terminal repair for native
Responses streams. Grok Build renders text deltas immediately but derives its durable assistant
turn from `response.completed.response.output`; an OpenAI-compatible stream may instead place the
complete items in `response.output_item.done` and finish with an explicit empty output array. For
that marked client only, OpenCodex uses a terminal-only tracker: it retains bounded, contiguous,
unique and semantically valid raw completed items, then backfills a missing or empty terminal
snapshot. It never promotes locally synthesized or merely repaired items. Unmarked callers continue
to treat an explicit empty array as authoritative. Within this marked client-facing repair,
malformed, gapped, oversized, contradictory, failed, or incomplete streams stay fail-closed.

### Grok Reset Coupons (Billing API Parity)

- **Upstream RPCs:** `prod_mc_billing.ConsumerUiSvc/GetRemainingResets` (inspection) and `prod_mc_billing.ConsumerUiSvc/RedeemReset` (redemption).
- **Transport:** Binary gRPC-Web over HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 with 5-byte frame envelope (`0x00` data / `0x80` trailers) and protobuf wire format. Plain JSON is rejected with empty responses upstream.
- **Authentication:** `Authorization: Bearer <xai OIDC access token>` + `X-XAI-Token-Auth: xai-grok-cli`. No cookies required.
- **Safety & Idempotency:** Managed via `src/grok/reset-coupon-ledger.ts` using UUIDv4 operation tracking before upstream dispatch to prevent duplicate consumption during network flakes.
- **Surfaces:** `ocx account grok-reset-coupons` in the terminal, and the dashboard at Providers > xAI Grok > Accounts, where each OAuth row carries a ticket badge with its remaining count and opens a redemption dialog (`gui/src/hooks/useGrokResetCoupons.ts`, `gui/src/components/provider-workspace/GrokResetCoupons.tsx`). The dashboard reads one `GET /api/grok/reset-coupons` per account with at most three in flight, always sends an explicit `tokenId` and a client-minted `operationId`, and treats redemption truth as the settled `code` rather than HTTP 200 ??a replayed *failure* returns 200 with `replayed: true`. After a request times out it issues no further consume call, because a redemption whose ledger record is still `open` re-executes.

Usage consumers preserve positive incomplete-history metadata as specified in [usage accounting](../gui-and-management-api.md#usage-accounting); readable totals are not represented as a complete ledger. Upstream API-key usage follows the [physical-attempt account attribution contract](../gui-and-management-api.md#upstream-key-account-attribution), independently of subscription quota observations.

Connected CLI usage follows the [client-scoped hub usage contract](../gui-and-management-api.md#usage-accounting); local management and account data remain separate.

Remote Workspace uses a separate, explicitly enabled server surface with structural WebSocket callbacks and awaited per-server cleanup; [its contract](../remote-workspace.md) owns that integration.

Listener startup diagnostics follow [the runtime lifecycle contract](../runtime.md#lifecycle); malformed optional listener blocks follow [config loading](../config.md#config-surface).
Chat helper admission in `src/server/responses/core.ts` follows the
[deferred stored-main contract](openai-tiers.md): only a needed Direct OpenAI helper
claims stored main, after terminal vision, routed vision and search exclusions.

Account-scoped OAuth quota remains display evidence for provider-level Combo selection; it does not acquire single-key inference-veto authority. See [scoped provider quota](../runtime.md#scoped-provider-quota-for-combo-selection).

The management quota DTO keeps Combo editing aligned with scoped inference evidence;
see [Combo editor routing quota](../gui-and-management-api.md#combo-editor-routing-quota).

Codex pool settings and their consumers follow the [reset-first ordering contract](openai-tiers.md#reset-first-account-ordering), including independent-quota fallback and preserved affinity.

Optional Codex transport-hint suppression is scoped to canonical Responses client output;
its defaults and exclusions are owned by [Responses transport](../transports/responses.md).

Grok chat raw reasoning uses content-channel output with an empty summary; hidden replay envelopes retain continuation text. Native Responses content is not promoted to summaries. See [chat compatibility](chat-compat.md).

Claude replay carries [Go conversation affinity](../data-planes/inbound-compat.md#claude-affinity-at-final-go-dispatch)
privately to final dispatch; preliminary route selection does not inject Go-only headers.

Devin CLI credential path composition in `src/oauth/devin/cli-import.ts` follows the selected platform: Windows uses Win32 APPDATA paths, other platforms use POSIX XDG-data paths. The explicit absolute override remains verbatim; credential parsing and login behavior are unchanged.

[Anthropic seed image metadata](../runtime.md#capability-aware-image-admission) is provider-scoped; xAI model metadata and transport behavior remain unchanged.

Provider-scoped catalog hints remain isolated by provider in `src/providers/registry/entries-core.ts`. The
OpenCode Go `deepseek-v4.1-flash` 1,048,576-token context hint does not change xAI model metadata or
transport behavior.
The first-party DeepSeek `deepseek-flash` native `text`/`image` declaration is likewise scoped to
the DeepSeek provider and does not alter xAI metadata or transport behavior; explicit capability
overrides remain authoritative. First-party `deepseek-chat`, `deepseek-reasoner`, and
`deepseek-v4-flash` remain sidecar-backed by default. Zen routes are unchanged and unprobed here.
The Crusoe fixed-key registry row, discovery predicate, effort ladder, and input-modality map are
also provider-scoped and do not alter xAI model metadata, OAuth routing, or wire behavior.

The Opper pool seeds in `src/providers/registry/entries-extended.ts` are also provider-scoped and
do not alter xAI discovery, model metadata, or transport behavior.

Native Chat applies qualifying effort ceilings independently of model pins; pin selection precedes the cap and only pins or cap rewrites enter wire mapping. The [catalog effort contract](../catalog.md#ultra-reasoning-level) records the V1/compaction exemptions and caller-preservation boundary.

Combo child requests normalize effort and thinking controls against the selected target while retaining reasoning summaries; strict unknown targets preserve caller controls. The [Responses transport owner](../transports/responses.md) documents this boundary, and native Chat removes effort only for an explicit empty declaration or no-reasoning model.

The [explicit model-capability contract](../config.md#explicit-per-model-capability-declarations) preserves operator declarations through provider storage and catalog capture; it does not infer upstream capability or change this surface's routing behavior.

Provider-scoped approval reviewer settings are projected by the [catalog owner](../catalog.md#provider-scoped-approval-reviewer); this surface retains its existing routing, transport and account-selection behavior.

Renamed fixed-key providers receive [missing reasoning metadata](../catalog.md#renamed-destination-reasoning-metadata) during derivation; explicit per-model entries and provider defaults retain precedence.

### OAuth Fast Tier (Priority Processing)

xAI's Priority Processing (`service_tier: "priority"` on Chat Completions and Responses,
documented for the API-key product) is honored by the Grok OAuth subscription gateway on a
probed model set (live probe 2026-09-13, `devlog/_fin/260913_xai_oauth_fast/`): grok-4.6,
grok-4.5, grok-4.3, grok-4.20-0309-reasoning, grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning, grok-build-0.1 and
grok-composer-2.5-fast each echoed `priority` upstream. The registry entry classifies exactly
that set in `modelSupportsServiceTier` and declares `chatServiceTier: true`, so the OAuth lane
resolves Fast-eligible per model: `--fast` synthetic rows publish, `fastMode` can force the
tier, and a caller-sent tier forwards (the Codex fast-toggle path). grok-4.20-multi-agent-0309
is deliberately excluded ??the gateway answers `service_tier: "default"` when sent
`priority`, so it keeps `forwardCallerServiceTier: false` and publishes no fast row.
Classification reaches saved configs through the fill-only enrich backfill
(`src/providers/derive.ts`); an explicit config value always wins, and a config saved while
the lane is live keeps it as an explicit value even if the registry default later changes.

The upstream tier echo relays to the client on every Chat Completions delivery shape
(`src/chat/outbound.ts` projections and `src/server/chat-native-sse.ts` chunks), matching
what the Responses lane already relayed for responses-wire upstreams; the responses-lane
assembly for chat-wire upstreams tracks the echo in attempt telemetry only.
Pool quota producers and account commands follow the [bounded raw-observation contract](openai-tiers.md#bounded-pool-quota-observations), separate from the latest display snapshot and capacity estimates.

Account quota surfaces use [safe probe diagnostics](../transports/inventory.md#account-quota-failure-diagnostics) separately from quota validity, credential health and routing authority.

Live sideband admission and its bounded upstream handshake follow the [runtime contract](../runtime.md#live-sideband-handshake); the ordinary Responses WebSocket exchange remains separate.

Translated audio/file admission follows the [final-adapter input contract](../adapters/registry.md#untranslated-input-media); native raw passthrough remains separate.

Shared response-log retention and native SSE inspection pacing follow the [bounded inspection contract](../transports/byte-accounting.md#response-log-inspection); other subsystem behavior remains unchanged.

Native steering retains fixed phase deadlines and reconciled replay output; see the [steering stability contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#steering-deadlines-and-replay-completeness).

Native steering generation overrides, explicit public-API eligibility and the consent-gated wire probe follow the [shared control contract](../transports/streaming-health.md#steering-settings-public-api-and-diagnostic-probe); this owner does not change routing or execute diagnostic tools.

Shared startup provider-id migration preserves the account binding between configuration and OAuth credentials; see the [runtime contract](../runtime.md).

Dashboard Fast-row persistence and client refresh follow the [Fast selector rows setting contract](../gui-and-management-api.md#fast-selector-rows-setting).
