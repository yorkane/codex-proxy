/**
 * A first-time provider add is the one moment the operator has no other way in.
 * Once a provider exists its workspace panel shows the authorization URL with a
 * copy button; during the first login no panel is mounted, so the hint has to
 * render inside the add-provider dialog or it renders nowhere — which is what
 * used to happen: the URL was fetched, stored in page state, and never drawn.
 *
 * The predicate is extracted from the JSX so the leak case is testable without
 * a DOM. That case is not hypothetical: the page holds ONE hint for whichever
 * login is in flight, and the Accounts tab renders many rows from it.
