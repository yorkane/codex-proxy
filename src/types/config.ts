   * remote connections outright, so there is no address to judge.
   *
   * The public listener's admission policy is unchanged. This adds an explicit local trust

   *    when `hostname` is a specific non-loopback, non-wildcard address (a tailnet or LAN IP),
   *    because otherwise the public socket already owns that loopback address. This is the
   *    one-port hub shape: remote clients dial `hostname:port`, local processes dial
   *    `127.0.0.1:port`, and every integration that hardcodes `http://127.0.0.1:<proxy port>`
   *    keeps working on a hub whose public bind they cannot reach (#4236).
