/**
 * The Windows-tolerant atomic replace.
 *
 * Windows can refuse rename with EBUSY/EPERM/EACCES while another process holds
 * the target — a scanner that just indexed the file, a sync client, a backup
 * agent. The hold is usually momentary, so a small bounded retry turns an
 * operational failure back into a successful publish.
 *
 * These cases pin the envelope itself: which errors are transient, which
 * platform retries at all, and that the retry count is bounded rather than
 * hopeful. The envelope is deliberately small (two retries, ~75ms), so an
 * accidental widening should fail here.
